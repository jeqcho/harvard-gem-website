Ariel is a gem of a human being and a great lecturer who introduces concepts clearly and concisely (it doesn't hurt that he's a Hamilton fan too LOL). I learned a ton about some very interesting topics in the CS\u2013gov intersection, and honestly this is the most engaged I've been in a CS class in a while. The psets are definitely HARD like start those early and work together because you will seriously regret it if you don't, and the final project definitely isn't a joke either, but honestly this class is one of the best and most rewarding ones I've taken at Harvard.

It is a bit stressful that the entire grade comes down to the video project, though at least the course staff makes it pretty clear what the expectations for the video are and also there are two possible submission deadlines (so if you do bad on the first, you can submit another to bring your grade up potentially). Also, the quality of conversations can either be really good or just okay depending on the table group you get.","workload_score_mean":3.79,"best_gem_comment_short":"This class is an absolute gem, and super interesting if you're generally interested in the history of computer science and reading CS papers.","course_id":"204964","link":"https:\/\/harvard.bluera.com\/harvard\/rpv-eng.aspx?lang=eng&redi=1&SelectedIDforPrint=44c288ea536f071562276744d80a90f673e0091aafb7159686254803490ba707e937abc01084f83b0a8b9732572eb7f7&ReportType=2&regl=en-US"},{"course_code":"COMPSCI 20","course_title":"Discrete Mathematics for Computer Science 001","course_title_2023":"Discrete Mathematics for Computer Science","course_score_mean":3.67,"rec_score_mean":3.81,"gem_score_mean":0.010989011,"sentiment_score_median":0.5106,"best_gem_comment":"This course was advertised as a gem, but don't take that for granted. You will have to spend a significant amount of time for the class, especially when midterms roll around because there is a hefty amount of material in the class, and it is easy to forget specific formulas or niche topics.
