Animal rights are such an overlooked yet pressing issue, and Sparsha clearly cares deeply about the topic and each and every student in the class! She gives amazing feedback on every single assignment and the outside events, while numerous, are all incredibly engaging (especially the trip to the Arboretum). WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT!!!!!!!",
