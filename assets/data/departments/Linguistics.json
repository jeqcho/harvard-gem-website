The material is fascinating and the professor was engaging and dedicated as a teacher. I say too easy because we only had five problem sets, no section, and at times that made me feel like I would've understood some of the material better if we'd had a little more resources \/ work on it. But I really appreciated the way Prof. Singerman tailored the material to the group and our interests, even in such a large class. Overall such a wonderful gem. This is the type of class that very concretely changed my understanding of the world, the type I would bring up fun facts from in conversation.","workload_score_mean":3.32,"best_gem_comment_short":"Overall such a wonderful gem.","course_id":"122514","link":"https:\/\/harvard.bluera.com\/harvard\/rpv-eng.aspx?lang=eng&redi=1&SelectedIDforPrint=23eda506abbcc672f30269617bab580f10e50415d6078d3e3cea68f55f2e3ae83ef3961d39f39519ed8e941ee34d2097&ReportType=2&regl=en-US"},{"course_code":"LING 106","course_title":"Knowledge of Meaning 001","course_title_2023":"Knowledge of Meaning","course_score_mean":4.19,"rec_score_mean":4.19,"gem_score_mean":0.0454545455,"sentiment_score_median":0.68875,"best_gem_comment":"A chill and fantastic intro to semantics, from someone who did not have a linguistics background. The course is accessible, fun, and has deep connections to concepts in CS\/math\/logic.
