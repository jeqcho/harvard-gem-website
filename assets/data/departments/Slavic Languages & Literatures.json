It does require some work, but it's totally worth it to read some of the best literature in the world. Prof Buckler is incredible, don't miss the chance to take a class with her. The overall classroom environment was incredibly welcoming and fun. It's great to know the names of all your classmates, and Prof Buckler and Brett really facilitated a positive classroom energy. Fantastic readings and course materials, including film, opera, and ballet. I learned so much! One of my all\u2013time favorite classes at Harvard and one that I know I'll look back on positively for years to come.","workload_score_mean":6.82,"best_gem_comment_short":"This course is an absolute treasure (not an easy gem, but a truly great course that you won't regret taking).","course_id":"207566","link":"https:\/\/harvard.bluera.com\/harvard\/rpv-eng.aspx?lang=eng&redi=1&SelectedIDforPrint=8cf78b2749f35014568a53359917fc550c5e7ee225395333c30c6a2df70132524db49c046588d9573a0c80fecac47737&ReportType=2&regl=en-US"}]
