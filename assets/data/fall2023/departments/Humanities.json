It's a fantastically designed intro class; no matter your experience, you'll leave this class with the tools to really engage with a piece of art, which you can use for the rest of your life. The lectures are hit or miss, but the good ones were some of my favorite lectures of college. Take it with friends and shoot the s*** talking about art, it's great for conversation. Not exactly a gem, since the weekly discussion papers can sneak up on you, but it's worth it to force you to actually have something to say about every unit.","workload_score_mean":5.48,"best_gem_comment_short":"Not exactly a gem, since the weekly discussion papers can sneak up on you, but it's worth it to force you to actually have something to say about every unit.","course_id":"122550","link":"https:\/\/harvard.bluera.com\/harvard\/rpv-eng.aspx?lang=eng&redi=1&SelectedIDforPrint=9a003793e3996680788445644816194eab5b735a56e6732e67a47d7369e62e7c8a481eea5e7404feae63e2775f37c6a3&ReportType=2&regl=en-US"}]
