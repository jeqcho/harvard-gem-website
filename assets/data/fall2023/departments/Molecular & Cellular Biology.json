I am taking chem 20 and chem 27 instead of one of the usual sequences and this is such a gem to fulfill the biochem class. There's not a ton of work\u2013 tests every other week on about 3 lectures worth of material and PSETs other week. The section is helpful so I would definitely go. The tests also aren't bad and focus on big picture ideas instead of insane details.","workload_score_mean":6.92,"best_gem_comment_short":"I am taking chem 20 and chem 27 instead of one of the usual sequences and this is such a gem to fulfill the biochem class.","course_id":"110450","link":"https:\/\/harvard.bluera.com\/harvard\/rpv-eng.aspx?lang=eng&redi=1&SelectedIDforPrint=ad4a7b8de78a2caeaaba084d653793adb51bb5d2e4ea22edfb235c4ba10d5b42fe6ecd17f611cc55004fb71405d398ea&ReportType=2&regl=en-US"}]
