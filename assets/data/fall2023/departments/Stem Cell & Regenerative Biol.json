There is really not too much work \u2013 the psets are pretty short and the exams are (relatively) low stress. However just because there isn\u2019t that much work doesn\u2019t mean that its a gem \u2013 the PSETs are graded pretty hard. The course casts a pretty wide net and you will go through information very fast, but there is always time to focus in on something specific that you are interested in for the final project or on certain PSET questions.  The content can also be pretty hard to understand sometimes, but I feel like I\u2019ve gotten a really good overview of the entire aging biology field.","workload_score_mean":4.25,"best_gem_comment_short":"However just because there isn\u2019t that much work doesn\u2019t mean that its a gem \u2013 the PSETs are graded pretty hard.","course_id":"125185","link":"https:\/\/harvard.bluera.com\/harvard\/rpv-eng.aspx?lang=eng&redi=1&SelectedIDforPrint=ee73505ec63de2eb58b72a8cafddf65b03fd84c8a5fbf7a066557962fe318d6ae393b956d424bc31918d38ad72daa58d&ReportType=2&regl=en-US"}]
