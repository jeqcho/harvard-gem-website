Likely the best chem class I have taken here. I think Chem27 enables you to explore the beauty of organic chemistry and biochemistry\u2013\u2013including several cool metabolic pathways and enzymatic reactions\u2013\u2013making the process challenging but motivating. The course material (printed lectures and section handouts!) is presented in clear and very engaging lectures by Professor Balskus, who very much emphasizes understanding concepts and knowing the 'why'\/logic of certain components of a given mechanism. Her OH are a very helpful resource. Anne Marie is also a gem in terms of her clear explanations for content. Much of the content also highlights applications for the material, which is a really exciting way to see these concepts in action. Psets and exams are fair, and OH are great if you are ever confused on any topics. This is a course for which if you invest the time and practice diligently, you can do well.","workload_score_mean":9.3,"best_gem_comment_short":"Anne Marie is also a gem in terms of her clear explanations for content.","course_id":"117558","link":"https:\/\/harvard.bluera.com\/harvard\/rpv-eng.aspx?lang=eng&redi=1&SelectedIDforPrint=fd0b611ec87d83f0502b43e2d812fd08972094311610bb5c5b986e1a71917ff89b8677b96ebe3354adfcba4ba967cf3d&ReportType=2&regl=en-US"}]
