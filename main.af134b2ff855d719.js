There are also concepts that come from human anatomy (either in papers like epidermal wounds, leukemia modeling, cardiac electrophysiology) that are introduced through a mathematical lens and changed my way of viewing processes like heartbeats, healing, and medication.Lecture: Honestly it is so useful when it comes to reviewing the steps you need to approach in solving a problem set question. Go to every class and write down everything Wes puts on the board, even if it takes a minute to understand. It might click as you work through problems.Problem sets: They\'re only once a week, which is so much better than Math 21a and 21b. If you\'re between this class and Math 22a or 22b, I\'d select 19a if you don\'t have experience with proofs. Also office hours were helpful because the TFs are patient and will guide you as you approach questions. Show up even if you barely started.Exams: It\'s nice that there are only two. It\'s scary that they cover so much content. One thing that caught me off guard is that your understanding of the readings is also asked. It\'s nothing tricky or too specific. If you take notes while Todd presents the key points in the article and later review his lecture slides (which contain more notes on Canvas) then you\'ll be ready. As for the math portion, make sure you know the rationale behind what certain topics are and not just the steps, because some questions will not be so simple as to just memorize the steps and write them down.Final Project: Start early!! Your proposal is due sometime in mid\u2013October. If you\'re learning about a certain concept in LS1a, LPS A, or another life sciences adjacent class, pick your favorite and find some math behind it. This way, it feels more interesting as you learn more and study for your other class. As long as you begin graphing models (at least one graph) before Thanksgiving break and continue before/throughout reading period, you\'ll be fine.Always reach out to Wes! He\'s a great person to talk to and genuinely is rooting for everyone\'s success. If his office hours don\'t work for you, reach out for an appointment!

This was the most well\u2013thought out, well\u2013planned, course I have ever taken. You will be amazed at how much you learn each week. The quality and joy for learning that Kageyama sensei and our awesome TFs nurtured throughout lecture and section was truly incredible. Another important aspect of the course to note is that there is an abundance of additional resources that perfectly align with the course on the Canvas page. Take advantage of them! The textbook and accompanying app for audio (you can download it for free) matched lecture perfectly and were excellently prepared as well. I have never felt so supported in a course and unlike other courses where the book or reference material doesn\'t match class, all the units are very systematic and if you ever get confused or need clarification, the book is guaranteed to have the answers to your questions. The course staff also holds \\"Nihongo Chat Hours\\" every week if you want more practice speaking or just one\u2013on\u2013one time to review. The course is one you need to dedicate time to, but it will be a rewarding and fun experience.

Chem major or not (if you need to take orgo for pre\u2013med for example), take this class!! Professor Myers is a wonderful lecturer and the teaching staff is great. This course is definitely difficult and will require a lot of your time. There\'s no getting around that. There\'s a lot of material covered and Professor Myers often goes through lectures at a very fast pace (to the point where if someone asks a question, he either advises them to speak with him after class or answers the question but we stay 2\u20133 min late after class because there is just no time). The teaching style worked very well for me, it was a traditional \\"professor lectures at the board for 75 min and you take notes\\" which I\'m used to and sections were great for catching anything I didn\'t quite get in class. Though Professor Myers may seem intimidating, he really isn\'t and genuinely wants to get to know students and just teach fun things in organic chemistry. Problem sets were certainly difficult and you can\'t do them without going to office hours. But it\'s usually manageable to complete the whole pset after 1  two\u2013hour office hour session if you start the pset beforehand and only come to office hours with questions. I can\'t speak to how helpful the PSLs are since I didn\'t go to their office hours after unhelpful experiences in chem 20, but TF office hours were extremely helpful. The teaching staff in general is very supportive and receptive to questions. Exams were sometimes fair, sometimes pretty difficult. You definitely need to study hard for them and you should probably make peace with simply letting the rest of your life take a backseat the 5\u20137 days before exams. There is however an alternative grading scheme which drops your lowest exam and replaces it with your final exam score which can help if you had a rough time with one of the exams (this was Exam 3 for most people this semester).  Lecture Integration problems were great for reviewing material that was covered recently and keeping it fresh, and they\'re basically free points (add up to an extra pset grade and they\'re grade based on completion) so do them!! Also PLEASE go to review sessions! They are \\"optional\\" in the syllabus (attendance isn\'t checked) but they are so great for reviewing the material and working on problems to really cement your understanding of the material. Professor Myers takes time out of his schedule to host the review sessions and works through the problems with students at the board which is incredibly helpful ( a little embarrassing sometimes if you are standing at the board for 20 minutes as your synthesis is being reworked, but SO helpful!!). Exam questions are also sometimes pulled STRAIGHT from the review session packets so at the very least go to them to be prepared for potential exam questions. The final was very fair (this year and in years prior since previous finals are given to us as practice finals) and I feel like represented the course material and the class itself quite well. You have to study a lot and put the work in, but it is certainly possible to get very high grades on exams and psets and be very successful in the class. Lab was alright, 4 hours is tough but the TFs tried to make labs fun and also get us out early which was very very appreciated and made the experience much better than it could have been.

You are left with very important and fundamental proofs done in class or in problem sets or reviewed in the textbook. It is also strongly recommended to LaTeX your psets, which is very helpful when reviewing the psets for the midterms or the final exam, but also takes a lot of time (in my experience, about 5\u20136 per week). The class is VERY well put together and structured. All the problems have a meaning behind and will probably be useful at some later time in the course (go to Wes\'s office hours to learn the \\"meaning\\" of each problem).  The reading, unlike other classes, are straightforward and helpful. The lecture notes are too! I strongly recommend not skipping lecture, even though it\'s a 3 times per week 9am class, since not all lecture videos are uploaded, and by actively participating you learn a lot easier. Also, it is pretty easy to get left behind if you don\'t attend lectures. One thing that I did not like were the solutions to the psets, which were not quite useful, because they were skipping a lot of steps, and not giving proper explanations. Another thing I really liked was Wes\'s openness. He was very supportive after the first midterm, and did not release the mean of the exam, which was emotionally helpful for the students\'s sake. He really emphasized self growth, which I have rarely seen in teachers. I strongly recommend going to his office hours if possible. They are not that useful for solving the pset problems, but for understanding class material, and its usefulness in other areas (Wes is an applied mathematician and gives many examples for applicability of linear algebra).  Also, you get to build a connection with a wonderful faculty member.

It\'s a really interesting continuation of the topics that Stat 110 covers but in greater depth and rigor. Reasoning by representation (e.g, proving results by connecting different distributions) is really powerful and interesting, and the measure theoretic foundation that Stat 210 provides makes probability (at least in my opinion) more intuitive but also more rigorous. Problem sets are fair and interesting, and exams are reasonable (the midterm was fair, and the final felt generous \u2013 I know it\'s been a bit harder in previous years though).Overall, the course feels more like an upper\u2013level undergraduate class compared to a graduate class \u2013 both in content and in enrollment. From what I know, for better or for worse, the course differs a bit from other schools\' graduate probability classes: it\'s less focused on measure theory (e.g., spends less time on rigorous constructions of parts of probability) and more focused on providing intuitive results and explanations. It also at times awkwardly balances between doing analysis (e.g., when proving the CLT) and not doing analysis (e.g., handwaving parts of measure theory and MGFs). I\'d definitely still recommend taking some form of analysis before this class \u2013 the class is definitely doable without it, but Math 25/55/112 or equivalent makes the course much more understandable (especially when it comes to topics like CLTs and LLNs). Also, taking Math 114 at the same time as this course is underrated \u2013 it makes the measure theory parts of this course so much more understandable, and depending on who teaches Math 114, it\'ll make the end of that class a whole lot easier too.Last bit because I would\'ve liked to have a review like this when I was looking at the QGuide: I self\u2013studied Stat 110 over the summer by watching the Youtube lectures, doing the psets, and reading the textbook \u2013 in the end, I felt really well\u2013prepared for Stat 210, and I think that it was a good move to take Stat 210. I came from a Math 25 background, and even though Stat 210 can be/sound a little intimidating, it\'s definitely doable, and if you already know some probability and like analysis, it\'s a jump worth considering. On the flip side, if your Stat 110 knowledge isn\'t fairly solid or you\'re not too confident in basic probability, Stat 210 will be a bit challenging. After a few lectures on measure theory, the class dives into reasoning by representation; if you\'re shaky on probability distributions, this (large) section and foundation of the course won\'t be very fun.","best_comment_short":"Also, taking Math 114 at the same time as this course is underrated \u2013 it makes the measure theory parts of this course so much more understandable, and depending on who teaches Math 114, it\'ll make the end of that class a whole lot easier too.Last bit because I would\'ve liked to have a review like this when I was looking at the QGuide: I self\u2013studied Stat 110 over the summer by watching the Youtube lectures, doing the psets, and reading the textbook \u2013 in the end, I felt really well\u2013prepared for Stat 210, and I think that it was a good move to take Stat 210.","best_comment_first":"If you liked Stat 110 (especially thinking about different distributions and how they relate to one another), you\'ll probably also like Stat 210.","course_id":"111696","link":"https://harvard.bluera.com/harvard/rpv-eng.aspx?lang=eng&redi=1&SelectedIDforPrint=4b53dd1d38e663e3a552990b6a0f0aa075335f9bd3c031b2a18fbbf4dece907b173da13ff4b62adcb210e30bc0e37fe7&ReportType=2&regl=en-US"},{"course_code":"HIST 82F","useful_title":"The Origins of the Cold War The Yalta Conference (1945)","course_score_mean":4.43,"rec_score_mean":4.21,"gem_score_mean":0,"sentiment_score_median":0.91065,"best_gem_comment":"","workload_score_mean":6.62,"best_gem_comment_short":"","best_comment":"This is a truly fantastic course.

This is likely due to the immersive and hands\u2013on nature of the class, which made it feel like I was really learning in a meaningful way.One of the best things about this class is its convenience and proximity to the quad. It was easy to fit into my schedule and attend regularly, which allowed me to make the most of the class. The workload was also manageable, with only a couple of short assignments to complete in addition to the dancing.Overall, I would say that Gaga dance class is a must\u2013take if you are in the quad area.

The material is engaging, it isn\'t easy given the higher level concepts, but it definitely is doable alongside other difficult classes.  The weekly work felt a little relentless possibly because OH were scheduled right before the work was due most of the time, so we all ended up cramming a lot of the work into the day before due dates, but the grading is nice, and getting an A is certainly not out of reach for most people. Just pay attention in class, don\'t get distracted on your computer, go to section, and take advantage of the time with the great course staff! Shubham, Manos, and Demba are gems and this class was fantastic.  Sometimes the psets got a little disorienting because it felt like we had never seen the material before, but looking back, they were so helpful in seeing how the concepts are applied.

Tracey is the goat fr fr, she straight up does not miss. If you\u2019re like me, then this class is going to go from very good to phenomenal. If you aren\u2019t (totally fine!), it might go to good.This class is very theory heavy while still being grounded. There\u2019s a lot of psychoanalysis, a lot of neoliberalism, some marx, a good amount of sociological theory, etc\u2026 Im very theory pilled, so I loved the readings, but if you aren\u2019t, it might not be the class for you BUT at the same time Tracey helps orient theoretical discussions around the actual happenings of the world, which keeps things grounded and present. I don\u2019t mean to make it sound all theory (it really isn\u2019t!!!), but it\u2019s definitely the most theoretical class I\u2019ve had that still ostensibly about ethnographies and studying particular societal trends.The class is about entrepreneurialism in the loosest of senses. We read about entrepreneurialism in the first week, then we never really discussed it again (which I honestly didn\u2019t mind one bit.) It\u2019s really a class about identity formation under capitalism. And, as mentioned, it is also very theoretical, so ideally for people who like theory and like Freud, Foucault, Butler, etc\u2026 I will also say that though the more theoretical texts DO connect with the more ethnographic readings (which come mainly in the second half) the connections are not always explicitly drawn. My personal only real complaint is that in class presentations from other students were quite long. TLDR; Tracey is a great great teacher, if you like studying theory, psychoanalysis, identity formation, and capitalism as not just an economic system, it\u2019ll probably be a GOAT class, if you don\u2019t, probably still quite good, but know what you\u2019re getting into.","best_comment_short":"And, as mentioned, it is also very theoretical, so ideally for people who like theory and like Freud, Foucault, Butler, etc\u2026 I will also say that though the more theoretical texts DO connect with the more ethnographic readings (which come mainly in the second half) the connections are not always explicitly drawn.","best_comment_first":"This class (or any future class that Tracey is teaching) is objectively very good!","course_id":"220409","link":"https://harvard.bluera.com/harvard/rpv-eng.aspx?lang=eng&redi=1&SelectedIDforPrint=11971f01d5c15736074ee396aad46ba8390edfafc8f1888f13749b5b120edc651fa87fce4777c0bee34888dec8292b90&ReportType=2&regl=en-US"},{"course_code":"WSTAFRCN AA","useful_title":"Elementary West African Pidgin","course_score_mean":4.14,"rec_score_mean":4.64,"gem_score_mean":0,"sentiment_score_median":0.7177,"best_gem_comment":"","workload_score_mean":2.77,"best_gem_comment_short":"","best_comment":"I highly recommend this course!

You develop a much better understanding of empirical study design, IVs, discrete choice models. This course is organized in a really satisfying way which feels a little different from other ec electives I\'ve taken. Most of the meat of the course is in learning about empirical research and study design. Therefore, the class is organized more around discussing tons of different recent empirical papers, rather than learning a ton of theory and maybe reading one or two empirical papers.

The second major thing I learned is how to understand and react to weekly macroeconomic and financial markets changes: things like new data releases on inflation, the JOLTS survey, BLS data, etc. I most appreciated the opportunity to sit in on Larry\'s teaching and hear him reason through all the current macro bombs that happened each week, the broader macro questions we were asking, his work on secular stagnation, his take/explanation on the papers of others, and his live feedback to the students that presented almost every week. This constant exercise of hearing Larry speak and reason through his thoughts and analogies was the MOST valuable takeaway from this course, and would not be received in any other economics experience elsewhere. It was a great privilege to get such constant, consistent, and timely live feedback from Larry and Paul on our presentations, as well as to have them advise us on one paper that we are working towards throughout the entire semester. The weekly student presentations on the papers we read were important as students should have a frequent exercise in the presentation of academic papers; it enforces close engagement with the material, solidifies understanding, and points out areas of confusion. However, most of the papers were over our heads, and it is certain that most students did not have a strong understanding of the academic papers. I wish we had more pedagogical experiences learning to understand these papers from Larry and Paul, after students presented, instead of us trying to make sense of the papers (often the blind leading the blind). If we could increase paper understanding to 80%+, then that would be an incredible achievement and benefit to future students. Lastly, like my peers have said, this course would benefit from an equalization of the floor at the onset of the class by having Larry and Paul teach about foundational macro finance principals in the first few weeks. The students that were not in FED challenge or did not have the privileges of joining FED challenge had a harder learning curve to makeup.","best_comment_short":"It was a great privilege to get such constant, consistent, and timely live feedback from Larry and Paul on our presentations, as well as to have them advise us on one paper that we are working towards throughout the entire semester.","best_comment_first":"To me, one of the most unique and important things I gained from this course is how to think about and explain complex problems with immediately understandable analogies\u2013\u2013this is perhaps the most important general learning tool I have taken away, and it is one of the key hallmarks of Larry\'s wit and brilliance.","course_id":"217408","link":"https://harvard.bluera.com/harvard/rpv-eng.aspx?lang=eng&redi=1&SelectedIDforPrint=a92c0bae13a5cd87339ae03f91a35f29f79443a30c3b4ba994b0cfb5b91ad29cbf09669b938837d947c4b6a6e7a8bcba&ReportType=2&regl=en-US"},{"course_code":"MUSIC 107","useful_title":"Advanced Ensembles","course_score_mean":5,"rec_score_mean":5,"gem_score_mean":0,"sentiment_score_median":0.6105,"best_gem_comment":"","workload_score_mean":3.13,"best_gem_comment_short":"","best_comment":"Great course if you are in jazz band \u2013 doesn\'t add a ton of work to your plate and is a good way to learn more about what you are playing within the ensemble.","best_comment_short":"Great course if you are in jazz band \u2013 doesn\'t add a ton of work to your plate and is a good way to learn more about what you are playing within the ensemble.","best_comment_first":"Great course if you are in jazz band \u2013 doesn\'t add a ton of work to your plate and is a good way to learn more about what you are playing within the ensemble.","course_id":"220622","link":"https://harvard.bluera.com/harvard/rpv-eng.aspx?lang=eng&redi=1&SelectedIDforPrint=7a7503d91fa136fb70c79747c790085df74f127cf154c7bf70620817ea74e260f914c79148e392fa1158efc77f918df8&ReportType=2&regl=en-US"},{"course_code":"EXPOS 10","useful_title":"Introduction to Expository Writing","course_score_mean":4.56,"rec_score_mean":4.33,"gem_score_mean":0,"sentiment_score_median":0.5106,"best_gem_comment":"","workload_score_mean":6.22,"best_gem_comment_short":"","best_comment":"Take this class only if you feel uncomfortable with writing.

If you\'re thinking about taking the course, do it! Find some friends to take it with you, clear space in your schedule, and deep dive into the course. It\'s definitely worth it; don\'t be deterred by any reviews. A few reasons the class stands out:1) Stratos and his lab are some of the most chill, yet cracked people I\'ve ever met\u2014just look at the awards they win. This translates to easy\u2013to\u2013understand lectures and a good introduction to research. Lectures teach you how to walk step\u2013by\u2013step through the different operators you learn about, as well as how to break down any high\u2013level database concept into the fundamentals: cache utilization, branching, etc. (I would suggest taking CS 61 before this course; I will note that I found the project easier than the psets in CS 61). Furthermore, doing database research is comparable to the work you do in lectures.2) You learn how to code\u2014independently. Unlike in CS 61, where the projects were contained to 1\u20132 weeks of work, no one besides you in this class (not the TFs nor Stratos) will know your entire database implementation because you\'ll be working on it throughout the semester. Besides the handout code\u2014which you can revamp to your heart\'s content\u2014you decide which functions to create and how they work, how to parse inputs, and how to return results. Attending lectures should provide a rough outline for you to follow, but besides that, you learn how to debug your code. (Please, please, please install Valgrind immediately after starting the course. I promise you\'ll save 2 weeks\' worth of time you\'d otherwise spend debugging weird errors and dealing with memory management in C. You can either launch an EC2 instance or run it through Docker). Modularize your functions, unit test new operators, and spend time thinking about the high\u2013level concepts (you should really only spend 30% of your time on this project actually coding); this project isn\'t bad once you realize how to break a big task into a collection of smaller ones. 3) The grading is very generous with extra credit, namely, on the midterms.

Anatomy consists of Dr. Milberg giving slideshow presentations on various structures/functions of the brain, sometimes using a human brain or a model. It can be easy to get a bit lost in this part of the course, so don\'t be afraid to ask questions. You\'ll also learn the most if you buy the workbook he recommends and actually use it. The anatomy section is tested with a relatively easy midterm. The second segment is group presentations on famous cases of abnormal cognition \u2014 think Phineas Gage, HM, ect. \u2014 that build on some anatomy knowledge but are generally interesting to work on & listen to. The take\u2013home final was based on these cases. Our seminar was also offered an opportunity during reading period to do one last \\"cutting\\" of the brain to access some of the structures we weren\'t able to physically see earlier in the class.\xa0Overall, I\'d highly recommend the course \u2014 it\'s a \'gem\' in it\'s low required workload (again, you get the most if you do work outside of class that\'s not required) BUT it is also extremely interesting. Dr. Milberg is a gem of an instructor. He is incredibly knowledgable, friendly, accessible, and has a lot of interesting personal stories about cases he\'s seen throughout his career. This is a low\u2013stakes way to learn brain anatomy (which is surprisingly lacking in the College\'s neuroscience department) because the workload is very low and Milberg is very willing to entertain questions. Even if anatomy is not the most interesting subject for you (as it wasn\'t for me), examining a real human brain is a unique opportunity that is hard to come by. The cases were also very interesting with a good mix of diversity. I didn\'t think I had retained that much from the anatomy section but I was surprised at how much I actually remembered when we came to the cases.","workload_score_mean":2.2,"best_gem_comment_short":"Overall, I\'d highly recommend the course \u2014 it\'s a \'gem\' in it\'s low required workload (again, you get the most if you do work outside of class that\'s not required) BUT it is also extremely interesting.","course_id":"109866","link":"https://harvard.bluera.com/harvard/rpv-eng.aspx?lang=eng&redi=1&SelectedIDforPrint=c4d23fc548fdf238167bfbff217eb28a498111847b393d0ce1a18dd3bf1e614f411a5d90cb5225cb3b8eb1e0341fce99&ReportType=2&regl=en-US"},{"course_code":"GOV 1737","useful_title":"Evaluating the Impacts of Public Policies How to Design and Implement Randomized Controlled Trials","course_score_mean":4.77,"rec_score_mean":4.69,"gem_score_mean":0.1428571429,"sentiment_score_median":0.8481,"best_gem_comment":"Truly a gem!

I developed a bigger appreciation for classical music but also became able to think about more modern music in a completely new light.2. IT\'S NOT MUCH WORK AND NOT STRESSFUL AT ALL: A true gem. INCREDIBLY interesting lectures and course material, great assignments, also a SUPER polished and organized course. And truly, this course is not very difficult or stressful. Still, I was motivated to do well because the teaching staff is so great, which brings me to...3. THE COURSE STAFF: Oh. my. god. I LOVED my TF in this class (Cana McGhee, she\'s a gem), but the other ones were also SICK. Section was such a joy, had amazing convos, great music listening, and always walked out having Shazam\'d at least 2 new songs.4. MICHAEL UY: This man right here, is just, *chef\'s kiss*. Never have I had a professor so eloquent, enthusiastic, personable, funny, polished, relatable, and SO INTELLIGENT at the same time. Every lecture, every moment of this course was made so enjoyable because of Michael. He also knew everyone\'s name (I\'m talking like 120 people) after the second week.

From sharing fun facts about ourselves at the start of class to watching documentaries on cons, I felt like I learned so much about my classmates and the world in general.

This is simply fact. You will find a great community of students and really welcoming teaching faculty who will assist you in every way they can. Some people might describe this class as scarring yourself with knowledge such that you build scar tissue to protect you from the trauma of future classes at Harvard and beyond, but it is important to remember that this metaphorical scar is composed of learning the most wide array of topics possible for an introductory course and that in and of itself is valuable.  It can help narrow down what you are interested in studying or fill in the gaps of a subject you may have felt initially weak in.  Another benefit is that the speed of learning and organization of this class will likely prepare you for rigorous courses that have plentiful resources and study aids down the line since LS50 is much more amorphous in the material it covers. Regardless, you will have to be dedicated to the pursuit of learning and thinking like a researcher over worrying over the granularity of your grades. If you focus on the minutiae of points, this is not the class for you and you will likely feel that the outcome of this class is not worth the work entailed. The perception of difficulty and  challenge within this course is only natural and there are many points throughout the course where no student has a detailed background in what is being taught, creating a more even playing field. Personally, the second semester has been exponentially easier than the first in terms of psets and exams although it\'s not a complete pushover.  Given that LS50 restricts 5 out of the 8 courses you take within your freshman year, I believe the second semester\'s lowered difficulty will allow you to take on an additional 1 or even 2 courses. With all that said, this class is definitely not for everyone. If you are not interested in exploring the integration of mathematical and physics based components into biology or chemistry, immediately walk away and run in the other direction. Ls1B and LS1A are much better fits for people interested in pure bio and chem. If you are somewhere wavering in between and wondering why this inclusion of math in biology is important or even remotely interesting, it allows you to dive deep into the mechanics of cells and life that are often taken for granted in typical life science courses and presents a useful paradigm for research questions and modeling of biological systems. Personally, I entered this course much more interested in medicine than research but in exiting, I have grown to appreciate research more in tandem with medicine. Deciding to take this course is a pretty huge decision and one that should not be left up to your ego. It\'s important to level your expectations by consulting with a previous student or some members of the teaching faculty but even in cases where expectations were not necessarily aligned with the reality of the course, there is a general consensus of feeling extremely rewarded by all this class has to offer.","best_comment_short":"You will find a great community of students and really welcoming teaching faculty who will assist you in every way they can.","best_comment_first":"LS50 WILL BE THE DEFINING PART OF YOUR FRESHMAN YEAR if you decide to take this course.","course_id":"159707","link":"https://harvard.bluera.com/harvard/rpv-eng.aspx?lang=eng&redi=1&SelectedIDforPrint=58302da63369f8e5375422e81d286e10a71f2fad57897c155d241efee983695b9cc16eb035ac9907e2ae98acf49cd17d&ReportType=2&regl=en-US"},{"course_code":"HAA 42P","useful_title":"Architecture through the Ages Notre-Dame-de-Paris","course_score_mean":4.6,"rec_score_mean":4.63,"gem_score_mean":0,"sentiment_score_median":0.9106,"best_gem_comment":"","workload_score_mean":4.6,"best_gem_comment_short":"","best_comment":"Fantastic HAA course.

As I age and mature, I find myself a little less pliable, elasticity slowly bowing to rigidity. And yet, this class was a belonging space for me and a resounding one at that. In my PhD program my writing had been everything but handled tenderly. I\u2019m under no delusion that my writing doesn\u2019t need work; however, I\u2019ve never been in a space where we are so strongly encouraged to find the good, the cors and to make a piece the best version of itself not your best version. Academia has largely severed my connection with writing although it was my lifeblood as an introverted child working through what I now recognize as trauma. I\u2019ve gradually lost my connection to the sustaining power of this art, compounding my pain. This class has begun to mend that relationship. It\u2019s forced me to see the good in my own work. It\u2019s pushed me to offer myself the same tenderness that I seek to offer others.Within the first few classes, if not the first class, Meng was able to invite us into a space where not only were we affirmed, but so too was our writing. The writing exercises early on both excited and intimidated me. Watching the ink spread on my page gave form and life to my ideas. So many of them have gone untilled, unattended that it seemed impossible to ever watch them flower and fruit. Within the greenhouse of our classroom, as I released my cors into the atmosphere and so did my peers, our gifts collided, thickened, and nourished us all. I\u2019ve learned so much from this class. Let the erotic lead you to the \u201cI.\u201d Continually asking myself, \u201cwhat comes through the hole?,\u201d diverging from tropes and detouring from the paths our minds try to take us for a more excellent way, and, of course, \u201ctell, don\u2019t show.\u201d But even beyond these, the hardest lesson Meng has taught is the importance (and challenge) of writing the good. the beautiful. the delightful. I must admit, this is a lesson that I will be learning for the rest of my life, but it\u2019s one of which I\u2019m beginning to appreciate the value. I really needed this class. It has done more for me than I can adequately express.

This isn\'t really the worst thing \u2013 the textbook is wonderful in my opinion \u2013 but it makes the value proposition of a 9am lecture not great. Similarly for sections. That being said, I went to CA office hours regularly (shoutout to David and Christine) and found a ton of support and camaraderie in the class.The psets are a good mix too. I personally like the probability side of the class (i.e. Poisson processes, Brownian motion, Ito calculus) far more than the computational side (Markov chains, Metropolis\u2013Hastings, etc.), so I enjoyed the latter half of the class exponentially more than the front half. The first couple psets are quite bashy, and the fourth pset on MCMC is literally all in R (you should be ready to learn R, because you\'ll be using it liberally), but the rest are generally fine, and often quite elegant.Finally, the exams are hard, and they\'re a big chunk of your grade. If I had known how hard, I would have seriously considered not taking the class \u2013 unlike the psets, which are almost entirely textbook questions, the exams are hard because you have to apply course concepts in ways that were really never explained or described in lecture/section. If you\'re not used to that (for ref., lots of people in the course took stat 210 before this or are upperclassmen stats concentrators), the exams will be hard \u2013 I\'m a potential math concentrator who took three other math/stat classes, and they definitely were my hardest exams.

First of all, Prof. Auroux is wonderful. He\'s incredibly accessible and cares about making sure people are doing well. He is going to be in France next year, but I\'m sure whoever is teaching 55 in 2022\u20132023 will be great! The material is really beautiful (although you can certainly have more of a taste for certain things than others), and it feels ever\u2013so\u2013slightly more chill than 55A.The material is honestly quite interesting. Topology \u2013 and especially algebraic topology\xa0\u2013 is a fundamental discipline to basically anything, and Auroux\'s presentation of complex analysis is very good for getting you to appreciate just how beautiful of a subject it is. Full disclosure, I am not the biggest analysis fan \u2013 I liked alg top far more \u2013 and I didn\'t have any experience with real analysis. Yet, often during the two weeks we talked about real analysis, there was a general sentiment of \\"yeah this is all stuff we should know.\\" The point being: this class is technically an introduction to all these fields, but unless you\'re ready and willing to make it the center of your spring semester, it won\'t be a very comfortable introduction.The psets were also generally fun. There were some questions that definitely should have been marked as challenge problems that were simply not, but beyond that they were good. Do start psets early, or at least look at them early \u2013 it takes time for things to sit and be mulled over in your head! The exams can be a big source of stress, but I think they were generally easier than in 55A \u2013 analysis at this level is often \\"done on autopilot,\\" in that there\'s only so many tricks you can try before something ends up working. Overall, try to stay on top of the material \u2013 it is much harder than you expect to catch up if you fall behind, speaking from experience.On the other hand, the class environment in 55B is... less than stellar. Your best hope is to find a good group of people to pset with that aren\'t magnets for drama, but in my case, there was so much drama going on that I didn\'t go to lecture for a very long time. 55 attracts a very specific kind of person \u2013 generally, people who enjoy suffering, or enjoy watching other suffer around them, and people who, as mathematicians, haven\'t quite mellowed out from the cutthroat, competitive, and prestige\u2013centric attitude that high school math things breed. If I could have taken the class entirely remotely, I probably would have.So, should you take 55B? First, I don\'t think 55A is a strict prerequisite, but definitely a soft one \u2013 the familiarity with group theory is essential for alg top. And as my experience goes, I think there\'s basically no barrier to entry, save for how much time you\'re ready to put into it. If you want math to be the center of your spring semester, then go for it. If not, then take 25B or 22B, or whatever is best for you (you\'ll quickly realize that if prestige is what you\'re shooting for, your mental and physical wellbeing are high costs to pay for it). In any case, good luck with your decision and whatever you choose to do!","best_comment_short":"The material is really beautiful (although you can certainly have more of a taste for certain things than others), and it feels ever\u2013so\u2013slightly more chill than 55A.The material is honestly quite interesting.","best_comment_first":"Math 55B was a very interesting course.","course_id":"112871","link":"https://harvard.bluera.com/harvard/rpv-eng.aspx?lang=eng&redi=1&SelectedIDforPrint=1af56bc14b1ced2eb0a233db1f648addea9bbe054e39d544db23c3b375ace0acf27ef9d46b1d84a94f9180f2dd3e0854&ReportType=2&regl=en-US"},{"course_code":"EXPOS 40","useful_title":"Public Speaking Practicum","course_score_mean":4.7,"rec_score_mean":4.8,"gem_score_mean":0,"sentiment_score_median":0.9244,"best_gem_comment":"","workload_score_mean":3.8,"best_gem_comment_short":"","best_comment":"Your experience is very dependent on who your section leader is.

The material is so insanely well taught. Wes\'s strength is in analysis so he motivates examples and provides intuition really well. The lectures are very good, and he answers all questions during the lectures. However, this results in the fact that most classes end around five minutes over time, and additional videos may be posted if the material isn\'t completely covered. Also, this class was a 9AM three times a week (with no recordings), so just make sure you\'re prepared for this. The community is really great, and many students in this class actually did not come from a high school math background but were more so interested in fields that require knowledge of real analysis. Because of this, a collaborative environment was fostered. I think it\'s really important to find people to pset with, if not the most important. Definitely definitely attend Wes\'s office hours. He is an amazing professor but also such a kind person, and it\'s very nice to get to know him! He can also clarify gaps in your knowledge about lecture material. For psets, I think it\'s more helpful to go to the CAs office hours since you can collaborate with students, but Wes gives great intuition behind how to solve the problems. This class is extremely rewarding, in my opinion, if you put in the time. Because the psets are not graded harshly, it felt that a lot of my energy was spent truly learning the material instead of perfecting pset solutions like in some other classes. Overall, this class is tough but rewarding.

This class is accessible to a fairly wide range of math backgrounds, has a good balance of definitions and interesting results (i.e. not too many of the former and plenty of the latter), and the problem solving on the PSets and exams is mostly satisfying. I\'ll now get into more detail about what I felt were this class\' pros and cons.Pros:\u2013 Lectures. Dr. Balibanu does an amazing job explaining difficult concepts so that everyone can understand them. Coming from a limited math background (only previous math courses were 21a/b, with some proof\u2013writing experience), I was somewhat apprehensive about my level of preparation for the class. The most out of place I ever felt was occasionally when she would ask, \\"who here has at least heard of concept X,\\" to which most of the class excluding me raised their hands. However, she would go on to then clearly explain the concept and how it related to the material at hand. Despite my minimal prior math experience, I found the lectures very clear and easy to follow. This was especially evident when trying to self\u2013teach myself the concepts from textbooks \u2013\u2013 the lectures were significantly easier to learn from.\u2013 Course content. Obviously this is very subjective, but complex analysis lies at the intersection of many areas of math wherein many interesting results are fairly easily accessible, without needing to get bogged down in too many definitions. The class is at face value an extension of multivariable calculus to the complex numbers, and it provides very nice ways to think about otherwise difficult problems such as the fundamental theorem of algebra, certain real\u2013valued integrals and infinite sums, and the Riemann zeta function. It is clear that the concepts of complex analysis are very useful for future areas in math, but even if you\'re not planning on continuing to study math, they are also pretty fun to learn/think about in and of themselves.\u2013 Course staff. As previously mentioned, Dr. Balibanu is a great lecturer. She is also generally very accessible in office hours and in Slack, and the TFs are similarly helpful, especially in the resources and review sessions they have before tests.\u2013 Grading. The grading for this course is half PSets and half exams. The PSets can be tricky and occasionally take a while, but office hours are great in helping to get through them, and they are graded leniently. The exams are very fair \u2013\u2013 the problems are often easier versions of those from the PSets, and lots of points are given just for remembering definitions (btw \u2013\u2013 when studying, make sure to know all the results, especially those with names).Cons:\u2013 Course materials. Outside of lecture, the only real supplementary course resource is the textbook which, as I previously mentioned, can be difficult to learn from. This is fine if you go to all the lectures and take good notes, but there are no lecture notes/recordings to help catch you up to speed if you don\'t (though this was Dr. Balibanu\'s first iteration of the course, so maybe this will change).\u2013 Feedback. The only feedback given is the PSet and exam grades. The exams were graded pretty quickly, which was appreciated. However, the PSets often took many weeks to be returned, which especially mattered given that there were (generally) no PSet solutions available other than by going to TFs during office hours and asking for explanations.\u2013 Computational homework problems. The PSets were a mix of conceptual and computational problems. While the conceptual problems were generally good concept review, the computational problems sometimes became tedious and felt like busywork.","best_comment_short":"It is clear that the concepts of complex analysis are very useful for future areas in math, but even if you\'re not planning on continuing to study math, they are also pretty fun to learn/think about in and of themselves.\u2013 Course staff.","best_comment_first":"Overall, this is a great class \u2013\u2013 if you are at all interested in theoretical math and especially if it is still being taught by Dr. Balibanu, definitely take it.","course_id":"113608","link":"https://harvard.bluera.com/harvard/rpv-eng.aspx?lang=eng&redi=1&SelectedIDforPrint=e3fcf59b25cb7523a5778751dbb08c92a4fe7bc67e90061e898cdf99b8caa9c0fc4b5878ad11c978f0e74e92a0ef82db&ReportType=2&regl=en-US"},{"course_code":"HISTSCI 99B","useful_title":"Tutorial - Senior Year","course_score_mean":4.39,"rec_score_mean":4.55,"gem_score_mean":0,"sentiment_score_median":0.7835,"best_gem_comment":"","workload_score_mean":14.89,"best_gem_comment_short":"","best_comment":"Writing a thesis was super rewarding and I highly recommend it!!!

While I really liked the teaching staff, it did feel pretty chaotic and disorganized most of the time. This class was the most \\"english\\" class I have taken so far \u2014 nearly every other sentence was a reference to a canonical piece that I had not read so I often felt pretty out of my wheelhouse.

So often class was just talking about random (although interesting) things that weren\'t always super central to the text. The assignments were pretty flexible though \u2014 up to two creative assignments out of four total.

Taking Ross\' Personhood in U.S. Constitutional Law expos was one of the best decisions I made my first\u2013year and I say this with full confidence. Ross is the best and he makes this course what it is. He\'s simply just an incredible educator. I feel like I had really outstanding teachers in high school,  so it was so amazing getting to connect with a college instructor who I felt cared for me like my high school teachers did. He is genuinely invested in seeing you grow and thrive as a student and this is something that you will come to see and appreciate more clearly as the semester progresses. He will constantly check\u2013in with you and he\'s always happy to chat with you (one of the highlights of my semester was talking with Ross after our expos section ended). Besides the fact that Ross is just an incredible human and terrific preceptor, the course content is super interesting. A variety of really important Supreme Court cases make up the core of the reading for this class which is really cool. The discussions you\'ll have in class are nuanced, engaging, and really meaningful. You\'ll feel closer to all the people in your section because you collectively take on talking about very difficult topics. This is certainly a class that pushes you, but I think that was one of my favorite parts of the course. The rigor never feels arbitrary or unnecessary; it feels deliberate and productive. Ross has spent a lot of time fine\u2013tuning this course and that comes across when you\'re a student in the course who can see how well\u2013run it is.

It\'s the best class (not just best CS class) that I\'ve taken in my 4 years at Harvard. KB and Brian are so incredibly kind, encouraging, and supportive of your interests and personal growth. I\'ve never been in a college classroom where I felt more safe and encouraged to fail, learn new things, and try again. I forgot how much my inner child loved learning until I took this class. Never once do you feel like you\'ll be penalized (with regards to your grade or anything else) if you try something for your project and it doesn\'t work, and that is something that I never felt before in 16 years of schooling, let alone in college.The assignments are comprised of a term\u2013long project, which can be literally whatever you want it to be (from a board game to a curriculum to an app), and case studies + reflections. All of the case studies are super interesting and somehow always relevant to your project, and each in\u2013class activity for each case study is a little different, so there\'s never a dull moment. The week\u2013to\u2013week workload is very much up to you. KB and Brian and super understanding that some weeks you make more progress than others. The best part about this class is that there is never any pressure to achieve perfection. The teaching staff genuinely just wants to see you thrive as a person by doing what you\'re passionate about. Also, there is a SNACK CART in class that KB will refill with snacks you request. KB is an absolute legend. She has so many amazing connections with people in the CS Ed space who actually come into class to provide feedback on your projects! Anyone you ask her to bring into class, she can probably get them to come because she\'s just an icon. Brian is a tech expert and always provides super useful feedback on your project. All of the people in this class are so, so nice. The teaching staff and this course in general helped me uncover an area that I\'m really excited and passionate about. The work you do in CS 196 feels purposeful and fulfilling. As cliche as it may sound, this course may have just helped me find my purpose.

Finally, if you are a student with strong religious convictions, I will say that this class takes a materialistic approach to religion, and so there are some interpretations/portrayals that you will not agree with because of a difference in first principles. That\'s fine, and you can also register disagreement (politely of course). It\'s a useful way to think about religious belief and activity, but just keep in mind that how you might see religion is different from how economics sees religion.Actually finally: YOU DO NOT NEED TO BUY THE BOOK. This was not clear to me.

Essentially, TL;DR if Wes is teaching this class, take it basically no matter what. If he\'s not, still take the class, but many of these comments might not apply.General (not teaching staff related):Personal academic experience: I came in with 25a and a pretty reasonable analysis background from high school. While this made the class significantly easier, and I definitely spent less time on it than 25a, it was still a difficult course, especially at the very beginning and very end of the semester. I still thus recommend taking 25b, even if you have previous analysis experience. For me specifically, when I took analysis in high school I didn\'t have a great linear algebra background, and I lost a lot of the intuition and appreciation for the material that I was able to gain in 25b. The course is an incredible deep\u2013dive into real analysis, and you come out of it with a very good understanding of the fundamentals. Notably, if you\'re thinking of taking 55b, that course doesn\'t cover real analysis in nearly as much depth\u2013\u2013from what I heard, they spent a week on it. Additionally, at least with Wes, he made sure that we got computational practice and worked with applications quite a bit, so for a non\u2013pure math concentrator I feel like this class might be more useful than 55b.The intensive nature of this class and the small size made the community very strong. While I feel like it was accentuated with our specific teaching staff, I think that this is probably a constant for 25. For 90% of the class, it was basically impossible to complete the problem sets without at least some (and often a lot of) collaboration. You often found at least 12\u201315 people of the 20 person class at Tuesday night office hours. These office hours are some of my favorite memories of my freshman year, not just because of Saint Knut, the CA for those office hours, but also due to the fervent communal energy that would often last late into Wednesday morning. It was a truly collaborative atmosphere\u2013\u2013everyone contributed, and everyone benefited. All of these qualities made the class feel more like a seminar\u2013style class than a classic lecture\u2013based one in terms of the tight\u2013knit community that formed. Adding to the fact that most of us had taken 25a and had known each other since the beginning of freshman year, I can\'t think of a better class in terms of community. I\'m serious: especially for STEM majors, you\'re not gonna get better than this.Wes:A gem among gems. Potentially the best teacher I\'ve ever had, and definitely the best math lecturer. I assume this applies to any class he teaches, so this almost certainly applies if you\'re considering taking 19a, 118r, or some other class that he\'s teaching. His lectures are sometimes transcendental experiences, Picard\u2013Lindelof proof in particular. (I\'m not joking\u2013\u2013I was literally dreaming about how beautiful the proof was the night after the lecture.) His enthusiasm for the material, particularly 25b material, is obvious and so infectious. He made the class feel like a journey\u2013\u2013with the Picard\u2013Lindelof proof, for example, he hyped up that proof specifically for weeks before we got to it, and when he finally proved it in class, the way so many of the concepts we had been learning about fit together so perfectly in the proof was just beautiful. He forces us to participate in lectures, and in a very constructive way that, combined with the clarity and deliberateness of his lecturing, made if feel like I could have proved the given proposition or theorem myself if I was given enough time. He also clearly and genuinely cares about his students, hosting numerous office hours and making himself available to schedule individual appointments whenever. His (sometimes intentional, sometimes not) humor also added to the lecture experience. Yes, it\'s a 9am three days a week, but it was so worth it. Wes does have a few annoying principles that he sticks to very stubbornly: the worst of these is absolutely no flexibility in deadlines (like if you submit something five minutes late you might get a zero). The exams are also in person and quite difficult, although if you study from the problem sets and lecture notes they\'re usually doable. All in all, the 25 sequence, including 25b, was one of my favorite and most memorable experiences from freshman year. Both 25a and 25b were my favorite classes each semester, due in part to the interesting material, but much more due to the fantastic people in the class, the community and the wonderful teaching we were privileged to experience. I got a little emotional at the end of the final lecture.

If you took Math 55a you are most definitely prepared to take on this class. We also had I think about 4 students from Math 25a and 2 students from Math 22.Based on my experience and other friends\u2019 feedback it feels that Math 55b was a decent bit easier than Math 55a and that in some sense last semester was the \u201creal Math 55 experience.\u201d Last semester we were forced to work together on hard problems for a long time and go to office hours for help, and as a result, we formed a close community and had a deeper understanding of the materials. To some extent this semester we had the continuation of that community but personally, I felt like I understood last semester\u2019s material better and had more interactions with the CAs and just everyone in the class.This course is titled \\"Studies in Real and Complex Analysis,\\" but on the first day of class, the professor explains to you that in reality, it is more like Math 131+Math113. We roughly had three units: 3.5 weeks on point set topology, 3.5 weeks on algebraic topology, and 5 weeks on complex analysis. As a result, we don\u2019t really dive into real analysis and students should learn this important area of mathematics on their own at some point.We followed Munkres\u2019 Topology through the first two units. In point set topology we learned about fundamental concepts such as product and quotient topology, connectedness, compactness, and separation axioms, which is Munkres chapter 12\u201334. So I would recommend future students who want to do some preparation during winter break to read this portion of Munkres. This part of the course was comparably more intuitive and chill (admittedly compactness is not very intuitive).In algebraic topology, we learned about homotopy equivalences, fundamental groups, Seifert\u2013Van Kampen, covering spaces, and briefly introduced topics like higher homotopy groups and homology. This is roughly Munkres chapters 51\u201357 and 79\u201381. This part of the course was quite difficult for me as it is harder to visualize and see the significance of these constructions. Later on, after learning complex analysis, I was finally able to see some of the motivations and applications of these concepts. Definitely try to go to office hours here, for me at least the problem sets involve a degree of hand waving and many drawings.About a week after spring break we started Complex Analysis, which according to Professor Harris is his favorite and most beautiful part of the course (as usual Joe is an absolutely fantastic and supportive lecturer). Here we followed Ahlfors\u2019 Complex Analysis, which honestly is quite terse and hard to understand (reading lecture notes beforehand helps). We started with holomorphic functions and with the introduction of the Cauchy Integral Formula we were equipped to take on harder problems. After learning about poles, singularities, and Laurent series, we did a good amount of Residue calculus which gave us important results about holomorphic and meromorphic functions.I have to admit, I personally did not find complex analysis to be particularly enlightening as it felt like learning a ton of cool formulas and then just applying them to solve some seemingly arbitrary problems. In retrospect, I actually liked the topology portion of the course better as they introduced new ideas I have never considered before. I will likely take Math 231, a course Professor Harris highly recommended.From my perspective my classmates took the following courses alongside 55b: quite a few took CS 124, a decent amount took Stat 111, some took Math 123 or 129 or 132, and a few took CS 181.Throughout this semester I have been thinking hard on what the point of taking Math 55 is. If a student took courses that taught the materials in 55 separately they may get a deeper understanding by virtue of spending more time on them. I have come to a few humble conclusions: I think by compressing a large amount of abstract mathematics into each semester we do get a slightly more surface\u2013level understanding of individual topics. However, at the same time, we got to see some connections between different areas of mathematics that would be otherwise hard to see, for example, algebra with topology, complex analysis with algebraic topology, abstract algebra with linear algebra; and I\u2019m sure some of the smaller topics we did like the exposure to basic category theory will serve us well in the future. I think I got a very solid overall \u201cfeel\u201d and overview of higher\u2013level mathematics. Moreover, 55 is really at its core about the community. I have met some of my closest friends and some of the most interesting people through this class. The late nights at Math Lounge and Math Library will forever be a sweet piece of memory lying in the foundation of my Harvard journey and I\u2019m sure years later my classmates and I will look back fondly on those days and laugh and shed some tears. I highly recommend anyone reading this to reach out to your classmates, schedule a lunch or a walk together and get to know them better. You will not regret this.Overall I think continuing with 55b was the right choice for me and most of my classmates from 55a. If you are considering this course, sit in on a few lectures and check it out! I wish you the best of luck!","best_comment_short":"Definitely try to go to office hours here, for me at least the problem sets involve a degree of hand waving and many drawings.About a week after spring break we started Complex Analysis, which according to Professor Harris is his favorite and most beautiful part of the course (as usual Joe is an absolutely fantastic and supportive lecturer).","best_comment_first":"Math 55b was an interesting experience.","course_id":"112871","link":"https://harvard.bluera.com/harvard/rpv-eng.aspx?lang=eng&redi=1&SelectedIDforPrint=457a1684046c241eeaea84daea2cda48fc6f8155cee39c09d3a1de631139e2ca82163a83f36ba95bfb0ce68856c85143&ReportType=2&regl=en-US"},{"course_code":"KOREAN 123XB","useful_title":"Intermediate Korean for Advanced Beginners","course_score_mean":4.82,"rec_score_mean":4.55,"gem_score_mean":0,"sentiment_score_median":0.8426,"best_gem_comment":"","workload_score_mean":6.64,"best_gem_comment_short":"","best_comment":"This is not an easy class, but it is incredibly rewarding and definitely worth taking.

Also, if you speak good spanish and your semester has the option of doing a spanish section like mine did, go for it! i loved mine.","best_comment_short":"I had heard many people say it was the absolute best class they had taken at Harvard, and I don\'t feel this way, to be honest, but it was super interesting anyways.","best_comment_first":"Levitsky is such a nice guy, and he puts a lot of effort into the lectures to make them engaging.","course_id":"146761","link":"https://harvard.bluera.com/harvard/rpv-eng.aspx?lang=eng&redi=1&SelectedIDforPrint=de16197b0737c3fe6de2fcb5a410063d770ce4167fc8410ef42b35ec2c5aa1cc402bd0035e0f6aa750b0e601ef7ccd26&ReportType=2&regl=en-US"},{"course_code":"PSY 1406","useful_title":"Biological and Artificial Visual Systems How Humans and Machines Represent the Visual World","course_score_mean":4.67,"rec_score_mean":4.74,"gem_score_mean":0,"sentiment_score_median":0.9557,"best_gem_comment":"","workload_score_mean":4.37,"best_gem_comment_short":"","best_comment":"This course is amazing.

That said, I would recommend it with reservations. Here is everything you need to know:First, what should you take, Chem 17 or Chem 20? Chem 20 is definitely a harder course based on looking at the Chem 17 problem sets and exams and talking to many people taking Chem 17. One main difference between the courses is that Chem 20 teaches organic synthesis, which is a pretty challenging skill. For context, most people I know didn\u2019t get a single synthesis problem on the exams fully right until the way end of the semester. That said, once you get the hang of synthesis, it is much more enjoyable than arrow\u2013pushing mechanisms, which is the focus of Chem 17/27. Another major difference is that Chem 20 has lab while Chem 17 does not. The lab was probably my least favorite part of Chem 20 just because it is so long (4 hours at night) and very tedious, but you have to do lab in Chem 27 anyway, so lab should not be a reason to avoid Chem 20. A third major difference is that the problem sets in Chem 17 are pass/fail, while the problem sets in Chem 20 are not. That said, there are so many bonus points on problem sets in Chem 20 that you can easily get 100% if you put in the work. Most people I know got 100% in the problem set portion of the grade, so don\u2019t worry about this portion of the course. A fourth major difference is the vibe of the course. The TFs, PSLs, and lead instructor of Chem 20 are way more supportive than in Chem 17 based on what I have heard. Everyone wants you to succeed and will help you as much as you want, which makes a challenging subject like Organic Chemistry much more enjoyable. Fifth, the exams in Chem 20 are apparently much more fair than in Chem 17. Don\u2019t get me wrong, you have to spend a LOT of time studying, but putting in the work will pay off, which is really rewarding. I have not heard the same thing about the Chem 17 exams, which are apparently are intended to trick you. Finally, the grading curve in Chem 20 is slightly better than Chem 17, but both grading curves are not particularly generous. A big difference, though, is that in Chem 20 the grading curve is fixed at the start of the semester, while the Chem 17 grading curve changes depending on how students are doing. As a result, Chem 17 is much more competitive because you are competing against your classmates. Just for reference, in spring 2023, you needed a 90 to get in A in Chem 20 and an 85 to get an A\u2013.To succeed in Chem 20, here is my advice. First, stay on top of the content as it is taught. This class moves really fast and it is cumulative, so do the purple book practice problems for each week\u2019s module. YOU WON\u2019T HAVE TIME TO LEARN ALL OF THE REQUIRED MATERIAL THE WEEK BEFORE THE TEST. Each exam is cumulative, so make sure you stay on top of the previous units as well. Second, go to office hours/helproom to work on the problem set. While there, really focus not just on the answers but on learning the material. The main factor that determines your grade in chem 20 is the exams, so treat the problem sets as a learning experience, not as required assignments that matter a lot on their own. The TFs are fantastic, so don\u2019t be afraid to ask them questions. Third, start studying for the exams a least a week in advance. Often, you will not realize just how much material has been covered until you sit down and start working through practice problems. The exams are pretty challenging, but for the most part are fair. Make sure to study the stuff you think you are not as good at, even if you don\u2019t think it\'s gonna show up on the test (because it probably will). Fourth, GO TO ALL OF THE LECTURES! Unlike LS1a and other intro classes, the lectures are not required/there are no poll questions to assess participation. But, that\'s because the instructors know they don\u2019t need to require people to come since the lectures are useful on their own. If you don\u2019t come to lecture, you will be in big trouble for the exams. Fifth, don\u2019t feel obligated to go to section every week since they are optional. Also, if other TFs are better, just go to their section instead of your own. Use section to help YOU; I often didn\u2019t go and still got an A in the class. Finally, Orgo lab is not fun, but it won\u2019t matter much for your grade, so just try your best and it will be fine, even if it doesn\u2019t feel that way when going through the class. Good luck!","best_comment_short":"Everyone wants you to succeed and will help you as much as you want, which makes a challenging subject like Organic Chemistry much more enjoyable.","best_comment_first":"Overall, Chem 20 was a good class!","course_id":"124312","link":"https://harvard.bluera.com/harvard/rpv-eng.aspx?lang=eng&redi=1&SelectedIDforPrint=41be18ff1b3e7b5d849477e1a9da0fba9a076ce91d69d77ca75e677fdb1639c7ccebe8fb75dde9406e59c0a4047dceb6&ReportType=2&regl=en-US"},{"course_code":"ECON 2060","useful_title":"Contract Theory","course_score_mean":4.67,"rec_score_mean":4.67,"gem_score_mean":0,"sentiment_score_median":0.8132,"best_gem_comment":"","workload_score_mean":6.67,"best_gem_comment_short":"","best_comment":"A great introduction to the foundational models of contract theory, and a great option to learn more about organizational economics.","best_comment_short":"A great introduction to the foundational models of contract theory, and a great option to learn more about organizational economics.","best_comment_first":"A great introduction to the foundational models of contract theory, and a great option to learn more about organizational economics.","course_id":"110708","link":"https://harvard.bluera.com/harvard/rpv-eng.aspx?lang=eng&redi=1&SelectedIDforPrint=19b3c4ad4a6d1242297722f3c5956ee4fe164261408b1d8329cdce6a08b4f4aa977932d2ec5099b9a8481a27050feec2&ReportType=2&regl=en-US"},{"course_code":"ECON 980Z","useful_title":"Behavioral Finance","course_score_mean":4.67,"rec_score_mean":4.42,"gem_score_mean":0,"sentiment_score_median":0.9152,"best_gem_comment":"","workload_score_mean":5.17,"best_gem_comment_short":"","best_comment":"Professor Stein is such an engaging lecturer and truly makes the class worth it!

I have some friends who have described the content in 123 as the most beautiful math they\'ve seen so far, while others have expressed more dismal views toward the topics of the class. Personally, I took 123 solely to satisfy the algebra requirement for math joint concentrators, and while I thought some applications of topics (e.g., Galois theory for the unsolvability of the quintic or the norm in quadratic number fields to solve Diophantine equations), I found much of the course content broadly not very interesting. Nonetheless, the content in 123 feels important to know as a math concentrator, and I\'m glad that I chose to take 123 to satisfy the algebra requirement. One of the main factors was probably Prof. McMullen, who is a captivating lecturer and makes the content feel tangible (e.g., through geometric explanations of algebraic topics) and clear. His exams were fair (potentially on the easier side if anything), problem sets were really helpful, and the course notes he posts provide some of the best explanations I could find.

The kids who had experience interning in finance and investment banking were at a significant advantage. Same with the kids who had taken some other sort of financial economics class. I also think that you would significantly benefit from the class if you were considering an Econ PhD down the road. The class definitely expects that you know a decent amount beforehand, like acronyms of random financial concepts, but you could always look these up or just ask the professor what they are. The class also has no textbook, so if you don\'t really understand lecture but want to grind the material at home, you\'ll really only have the lecture slides, which are kind of confusing when not paired with the lecture (and office hours, of course).That being said, if you\'re somewhat of an outsider to the field, you can still do well \u2013\u2013 just expect an uphill battle and the frequent feeling that everyone somehow knows more than you.

You\'ll get great insight into the decisions that policymakers and bankers face, and you\'ll get great exposure to contrasting economic ideas. Rather than just learning how to compute rote financial metrics,  you\'ll learn how to critically think about financial concepts and dynamics. I think that the type of thinking Stein teaches is not only valuable for those aiming to be leaders in the world of finance, but for anyone seeking to use analytical skills in decision\u2013making roles.","best_comment_short":"He\'s a very kind and brilliant professor \u2013\u2013 he memorized all of our first names \u2013\u2013 and this course is one of a kind at Harvard.","best_comment_first":"Can be very helpful to be comfortable with econometrics, otherwise you won\'t really understand the papers that you are expected to read and critique.","course_id":"156356","link":"https://harvard.bluera.com/harvard/rpv-eng.aspx?lang=eng&redi=1&SelectedIDforPrint=b4db2c9a93e22b92bf4fe1ea3f6fca2115c9c8827cffadadfdfc9919df4132103991b7088877786297a5086a3f50e7e7&ReportType=2&regl=en-US"},{"course_code":"HIST 15F","useful_title":"Political Violence in the Twentieth Century","course_score_mean":4.4,"rec_score_mean":4.2,"gem_score_mean":0,"sentiment_score_median":0.8765,"best_gem_comment":"","workload_score_mean":6.2,"best_gem_comment_short":"","best_comment":"This class was really interesting and if you are interested in the subject of violence and how it manifests, I would recommend this class.

Don\'t be mistaken, this course is definitely an incredible amount of work and normally we were doing about ~80 pages of reading a week, sometimes more, sometimes less but I\'d say on average it was about that much. However, with that said, coming into this class, I was not much of a reader but coming out of it, I\'ve genuinely improved my ability to quickly skim and pull out the most important parts from readings (which is a super great skill in my opinion to have). Professor Felter cares so incredibly much about ensuring that you succeed \u2013\u2013 he leaves a large breadth of comments on your assignments that makes it very very clear on how you can improve for your next one. I\'ve never had a professor be so thoughtful and engaging in our comments. He is extremely accessible outside of class, scheduling office hours 1\u2013on\u20131 with you around your schedule and it was wonderful getting to know him. He is a super cool guy overall \u2013\u2013 a lot of amazing stories from when he was a lawyer and through law school. Overall, I think this course is a pretty good introduction to what *might* be expected in a law school class and I think it genuinely helped convince me that I for sure want to go to law school because I was on the fence when I had taken this class about it. Additionally, even though professor Felter cold calls at times, what I appreciated was he never made you feel dumb or stupid or isolated if you didn\'t know the answer. He genuinely just wants to lead a nice and productive conversation during class and it\'s a much more enjoyable experience when everyone in the section has done the readings and is able to engage. I\'d for sure be ready to put a good ~10 hours into the course each week, at minimum, if you want to get a good grade and really engage with the content. Normally the readings took me around ~4 hours/week (probably a little more towards the beginning of the semester) to really dig into them and understand them (especially when we had to do our assignments based on the readings) and another good ~6\u20138 hours each week working on the assignments which again, professor Felter spends an incredible amount of time and care with grading them so I\'d for sure spend a good amount of time and care in writing them.

I got to win one of the dragons he gave out, as well as a toy robot from one of our class \\"intermission\\" exercises, both of which I still have and display on my desk. I was always interested in learning how people think, work, and decide, and this course was right up my alley! I\'m glad to now have precise terms to describe concepts that I understood intuitively, but could just never name. One of the greatest things in the course that I personally enjoyed was the integration of personal reflection, particularly in the Final Thing. Not only did Professor Ullman give us freedom to do whatever we wanted for the final project, he also frequently made us think about decisions we\'ve made and how its shaped us. I took the Final Thing as an opportunity to reflect on my personal growth and progress, and it was honestly one of the most insightful assignments I\'ve ever had. I\'ve also never had as much creative freedom in a course project, which is kind of sad that Harvard is so heavy on exams or writing assessments.
