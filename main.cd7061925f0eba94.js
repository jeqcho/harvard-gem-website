There are also concepts that come from human anatomy (either in papers like epidermal wounds, leukemia modeling, cardiac electrophysiology) that are introduced through a mathematical lens and changed my way of viewing processes like heartbeats, healing, and medication.Lecture: Honestly it is so useful when it comes to reviewing the steps you need to approach in solving a problem set question. Go to every class and write down everything Wes puts on the board, even if it takes a minute to understand. It might click as you work through problems.Problem sets: They\'re only once a week, which is so much better than Math 21a and 21b. If you\'re between this class and Math 22a or 22b, I\'d select 19a if you don\'t have experience with proofs. Also office hours were helpful because the TFs are patient and will guide you as you approach questions. Show up even if you barely started.Exams: It\'s nice that there are only two. It\'s scary that they cover so much content. One thing that caught me off guard is that your understanding of the readings is also asked. It\'s nothing tricky or too specific. If you take notes while Todd presents the key points in the article and later review his lecture slides (which contain more notes on Canvas) then you\'ll be ready. As for the math portion, make sure you know the rationale behind what certain topics are and not just the steps, because some questions will not be so simple as to just memorize the steps and write them down.Final Project: Start early!! Your proposal is due sometime in mid\u2013October. If you\'re learning about a certain concept in LS1a, LPS A, or another life sciences adjacent class, pick your favorite and find some math behind it. This way, it feels more interesting as you learn more and study for your other class. As long as you begin graphing models (at least one graph) before Thanksgiving break and continue before/throughout reading period, you\'ll be fine.Always reach out to Wes! He\'s a great person to talk to and genuinely is rooting for everyone\'s success. If his office hours don\'t work for you, reach out for an appointment!

This was the most well\u2013thought out, well\u2013planned, course I have ever taken. You will be amazed at how much you learn each week. The quality and joy for learning that Kageyama sensei and our awesome TFs nurtured throughout lecture and section was truly incredible. Another important aspect of the course to note is that there is an abundance of additional resources that perfectly align with the course on the Canvas page. Take advantage of them! The textbook and accompanying app for audio (you can download it for free) matched lecture perfectly and were excellently prepared as well. I have never felt so supported in a course and unlike other courses where the book or reference material doesn\'t match class, all the units are very systematic and if you ever get confused or need clarification, the book is guaranteed to have the answers to your questions. The course staff also holds \\"Nihongo Chat Hours\\" every week if you want more practice speaking or just one\u2013on\u2013one time to review. The course is one you need to dedicate time to, but it will be a rewarding and fun experience.

Chem major or not (if you need to take orgo for pre\u2013med for example), take this class!! Professor Myers is a wonderful lecturer and the teaching staff is great. This course is definitely difficult and will require a lot of your time. There\'s no getting around that. There\'s a lot of material covered and Professor Myers often goes through lectures at a very fast pace (to the point where if someone asks a question, he either advises them to speak with him after class or answers the question but we stay 2\u20133 min late after class because there is just no time). The teaching style worked very well for me, it was a traditional \\"professor lectures at the board for 75 min and you take notes\\" which I\'m used to and sections were great for catching anything I didn\'t quite get in class. Though Professor Myers may seem intimidating, he really isn\'t and genuinely wants to get to know students and just teach fun things in organic chemistry. Problem sets were certainly difficult and you can\'t do them without going to office hours. But it\'s usually manageable to complete the whole pset after 1  two\u2013hour office hour session if you start the pset beforehand and only come to office hours with questions. I can\'t speak to how helpful the PSLs are since I didn\'t go to their office hours after unhelpful experiences in chem 20, but TF office hours were extremely helpful. The teaching staff in general is very supportive and receptive to questions. Exams were sometimes fair, sometimes pretty difficult. You definitely need to study hard for them and you should probably make peace with simply letting the rest of your life take a backseat the 5\u20137 days before exams. There is however an alternative grading scheme which drops your lowest exam and replaces it with your final exam score which can help if you had a rough time with one of the exams (this was Exam 3 for most people this semester).  Lecture Integration problems were great for reviewing material that was covered recently and keeping it fresh, and they\'re basically free points (add up to an extra pset grade and they\'re grade based on completion) so do them!! Also PLEASE go to review sessions! They are \\"optional\\" in the syllabus (attendance isn\'t checked) but they are so great for reviewing the material and working on problems to really cement your understanding of the material. Professor Myers takes time out of his schedule to host the review sessions and works through the problems with students at the board which is incredibly helpful ( a little embarrassing sometimes if you are standing at the board for 20 minutes as your synthesis is being reworked, but SO helpful!!). Exam questions are also sometimes pulled STRAIGHT from the review session packets so at the very least go to them to be prepared for potential exam questions. The final was very fair (this year and in years prior since previous finals are given to us as practice finals) and I feel like represented the course material and the class itself quite well. You have to study a lot and put the work in, but it is certainly possible to get very high grades on exams and psets and be very successful in the class. Lab was alright, 4 hours is tough but the TFs tried to make labs fun and also get us out early which was very very appreciated and made the experience much better than it could have been.

You are left with very important and fundamental proofs done in class or in problem sets or reviewed in the textbook. It is also strongly recommended to LaTeX your psets, which is very helpful when reviewing the psets for the midterms or the final exam, but also takes a lot of time (in my experience, about 5\u20136 per week). The class is VERY well put together and structured. All the problems have a meaning behind and will probably be useful at some later time in the course (go to Wes\'s office hours to learn the \\"meaning\\" of each problem).  The reading, unlike other classes, are straightforward and helpful. The lecture notes are too! I strongly recommend not skipping lecture, even though it\'s a 3 times per week 9am class, since not all lecture videos are uploaded, and by actively participating you learn a lot easier. Also, it is pretty easy to get left behind if you don\'t attend lectures. One thing that I did not like were the solutions to the psets, which were not quite useful, because they were skipping a lot of steps, and not giving proper explanations. Another thing I really liked was Wes\'s openness. He was very supportive after the first midterm, and did not release the mean of the exam, which was emotionally helpful for the students\'s sake. He really emphasized self growth, which I have rarely seen in teachers. I strongly recommend going to his office hours if possible. They are not that useful for solving the pset problems, but for understanding class material, and its usefulness in other areas (Wes is an applied mathematician and gives many examples for applicability of linear algebra).  Also, you get to build a connection with a wonderful faculty member.

It\'s a really interesting continuation of the topics that Stat 110 covers but in greater depth and rigor. Reasoning by representation (e.g, proving results by connecting different distributions) is really powerful and interesting, and the measure theoretic foundation that Stat 210 provides makes probability (at least in my opinion) more intuitive but also more rigorous. Problem sets are fair and interesting, and exams are reasonable (the midterm was fair, and the final felt generous \u2013 I know it\'s been a bit harder in previous years though).Overall, the course feels more like an upper\u2013level undergraduate class compared to a graduate class \u2013 both in content and in enrollment. From what I know, for better or for worse, the course differs a bit from other schools\' graduate probability classes: it\'s less focused on measure theory (e.g., spends less time on rigorous constructions of parts of probability) and more focused on providing intuitive results and explanations. It also at times awkwardly balances between doing analysis (e.g., when proving the CLT) and not doing analysis (e.g., handwaving parts of measure theory and MGFs). I\'d definitely still recommend taking some form of analysis before this class \u2013 the class is definitely doable without it, but Math 25/55/112 or equivalent makes the course much more understandable (especially when it comes to topics like CLTs and LLNs). Also, taking Math 114 at the same time as this course is underrated \u2013 it makes the measure theory parts of this course so much more understandable, and depending on who teaches Math 114, it\'ll make the end of that class a whole lot easier too.Last bit because I would\'ve liked to have a review like this when I was looking at the QGuide: I self\u2013studied Stat 110 over the summer by watching the Youtube lectures, doing the psets, and reading the textbook \u2013 in the end, I felt really well\u2013prepared for Stat 210, and I think that it was a good move to take Stat 210. I came from a Math 25 background, and even though Stat 210 can be/sound a little intimidating, it\'s definitely doable, and if you already know some probability and like analysis, it\'s a jump worth considering. On the flip side, if your Stat 110 knowledge isn\'t fairly solid or you\'re not too confident in basic probability, Stat 210 will be a bit challenging. After a few lectures on measure theory, the class dives into reasoning by representation; if you\'re shaky on probability distributions, this (large) section and foundation of the course won\'t be very fun.","best_comment_short":"Also, taking Math 114 at the same time as this course is underrated \u2013 it makes the measure theory parts of this course so much more understandable, and depending on who teaches Math 114, it\'ll make the end of that class a whole lot easier too.Last bit because I would\'ve liked to have a review like this when I was looking at the QGuide: I self\u2013studied Stat 110 over the summer by watching the Youtube lectures, doing the psets, and reading the textbook \u2013 in the end, I felt really well\u2013prepared for Stat 210, and I think that it was a good move to take Stat 210.","best_comment_first":"If you liked Stat 110 (especially thinking about different distributions and how they relate to one another), you\'ll probably also like Stat 210.","course_id":"111696","link":"https://harvard.bluera.com/harvard/rpv-eng.aspx?lang=eng&redi=1&SelectedIDforPrint=4b53dd1d38e663e3a552990b6a0f0aa075335f9bd3c031b2a18fbbf4dece907b173da13ff4b62adcb210e30bc0e37fe7&ReportType=2&regl=en-US"},{"course_code":"HIST 82F","useful_title":"The Origins of the Cold War The Yalta Conference (1945)","course_score_mean":4.43,"rec_score_mean":4.21,"gem_score_mean":0,"sentiment_score_median":0.91065,"best_gem_comment":"","workload_score_mean":6.62,"best_gem_comment_short":"","best_comment":"This is a truly fantastic course.

This is likely due to the immersive and hands\u2013on nature of the class, which made it feel like I was really learning in a meaningful way.One of the best things about this class is its convenience and proximity to the quad. It was easy to fit into my schedule and attend regularly, which allowed me to make the most of the class. The workload was also manageable, with only a couple of short assignments to complete in addition to the dancing.Overall, I would say that Gaga dance class is a must\u2013take if you are in the quad area.

The material is engaging, it isn\'t easy given the higher level concepts, but it definitely is doable alongside other difficult classes.  The weekly work felt a little relentless possibly because OH were scheduled right before the work was due most of the time, so we all ended up cramming a lot of the work into the day before due dates, but the grading is nice, and getting an A is certainly not out of reach for most people. Just pay attention in class, don\'t get distracted on your computer, go to section, and take advantage of the time with the great course staff! Shubham, Manos, and Demba are gems and this class was fantastic.  Sometimes the psets got a little disorienting because it felt like we had never seen the material before, but looking back, they were so helpful in seeing how the concepts are applied.

Tracey is the goat fr fr, she straight up does not miss. If you\u2019re like me, then this class is going to go from very good to phenomenal. If you aren\u2019t (totally fine!), it might go to good.This class is very theory heavy while still being grounded. There\u2019s a lot of psychoanalysis, a lot of neoliberalism, some marx, a good amount of sociological theory, etc\u2026 Im very theory pilled, so I loved the readings, but if you aren\u2019t, it might not be the class for you BUT at the same time Tracey helps orient theoretical discussions around the actual happenings of the world, which keeps things grounded and present. I don\u2019t mean to make it sound all theory (it really isn\u2019t!!!), but it\u2019s definitely the most theoretical class I\u2019ve had that still ostensibly about ethnographies and studying particular societal trends.The class is about entrepreneurialism in the loosest of senses. We read about entrepreneurialism in the first week, then we never really discussed it again (which I honestly didn\u2019t mind one bit.) It\u2019s really a class about identity formation under capitalism. And, as mentioned, it is also very theoretical, so ideally for people who like theory and like Freud, Foucault, Butler, etc\u2026 I will also say that though the more theoretical texts DO connect with the more ethnographic readings (which come mainly in the second half) the connections are not always explicitly drawn. My personal only real complaint is that in class presentations from other students were quite long. TLDR; Tracey is a great great teacher, if you like studying theory, psychoanalysis, identity formation, and capitalism as not just an economic system, it\u2019ll probably be a GOAT class, if you don\u2019t, probably still quite good, but know what you\u2019re getting into.","best_comment_short":"And, as mentioned, it is also very theoretical, so ideally for people who like theory and like Freud, Foucault, Butler, etc\u2026 I will also say that though the more theoretical texts DO connect with the more ethnographic readings (which come mainly in the second half) the connections are not always explicitly drawn.","best_comment_first":"This class (or any future class that Tracey is teaching) is objectively very good!","course_id":"220409","link":"https://harvard.bluera.com/harvard/rpv-eng.aspx?lang=eng&redi=1&SelectedIDforPrint=11971f01d5c15736074ee396aad46ba8390edfafc8f1888f13749b5b120edc651fa87fce4777c0bee34888dec8292b90&ReportType=2&regl=en-US"},{"course_code":"WSTAFRCN AA","useful_title":"Elementary West African Pidgin","course_score_mean":4.14,"rec_score_mean":4.64,"gem_score_mean":0,"sentiment_score_median":0.7177,"best_gem_comment":"","workload_score_mean":2.77,"best_gem_comment_short":"","best_comment":"I highly recommend this course!

You develop a much better understanding of empirical study design, IVs, discrete choice models. This course is organized in a really satisfying way which feels a little different from other ec electives I\'ve taken. Most of the meat of the course is in learning about empirical research and study design. Therefore, the class is organized more around discussing tons of different recent empirical papers, rather than learning a ton of theory and maybe reading one or two empirical papers.

The second major thing I learned is how to understand and react to weekly macroeconomic and financial markets changes: things like new data releases on inflation, the JOLTS survey, BLS data, etc. I most appreciated the opportunity to sit in on Larry\'s teaching and hear him reason through all the current macro bombs that happened each week, the broader macro questions we were asking, his work on secular stagnation, his take/explanation on the papers of others, and his live feedback to the students that presented almost every week. This constant exercise of hearing Larry speak and reason through his thoughts and analogies was the MOST valuable takeaway from this course, and would not be received in any other economics experience elsewhere. It was a great privilege to get such constant, consistent, and timely live feedback from Larry and Paul on our presentations, as well as to have them advise us on one paper that we are working towards throughout the entire semester. The weekly student presentations on the papers we read were important as students should have a frequent exercise in the presentation of academic papers; it enforces close engagement with the material, solidifies understanding, and points out areas of confusion. However, most of the papers were over our heads, and it is certain that most students did not have a strong understanding of the academic papers. I wish we had more pedagogical experiences learning to understand these papers from Larry and Paul, after students presented, instead of us trying to make sense of the papers (often the blind leading the blind). If we could increase paper understanding to 80%+, then that would be an incredible achievement and benefit to future students. Lastly, like my peers have said, this course would benefit from an equalization of the floor at the onset of the class by having Larry and Paul teach about foundational macro finance principals in the first few weeks. The students that were not in FED challenge or did not have the privileges of joining FED challenge had a harder learning curve to makeup.","best_comment_short":"It was a great privilege to get such constant, consistent, and timely live feedback from Larry and Paul on our presentations, as well as to have them advise us on one paper that we are working towards throughout the entire semester.","best_comment_first":"To me, one of the most unique and important things I gained from this course is how to think about and explain complex problems with immediately understandable analogies\u2013\u2013this is perhaps the most important general learning tool I have taken away, and it is one of the key hallmarks of Larry\'s wit and brilliance.","course_id":"217408","link":"https://harvard.bluera.com/harvard/rpv-eng.aspx?lang=eng&redi=1&SelectedIDforPrint=a92c0bae13a5cd87339ae03f91a35f29f79443a30c3b4ba994b0cfb5b91ad29cbf09669b938837d947c4b6a6e7a8bcba&ReportType=2&regl=en-US"},{"course_code":"MUSIC 107","useful_title":"Advanced Ensembles","course_score_mean":5,"rec_score_mean":5,"gem_score_mean":0,"sentiment_score_median":0.6105,"best_gem_comment":"","workload_score_mean":3.13,"best_gem_comment_short":"","best_comment":"Great course if you are in jazz band \u2013 doesn\'t add a ton of work to your plate and is a good way to learn more about what you are playing within the ensemble.","best_comment_short":"Great course if you are in jazz band \u2013 doesn\'t add a ton of work to your plate and is a good way to learn more about what you are playing within the ensemble.","best_comment_first":"Great course if you are in jazz band \u2013 doesn\'t add a ton of work to your plate and is a good way to learn more about what you are playing within the ensemble.","course_id":"220622","link":"https://harvard.bluera.com/harvard/rpv-eng.aspx?lang=eng&redi=1&SelectedIDforPrint=7a7503d91fa136fb70c79747c790085df74f127cf154c7bf70620817ea74e260f914c79148e392fa1158efc77f918df8&ReportType=2&regl=en-US"},{"course_code":"EXPOS 10","useful_title":"Introduction to Expository Writing","course_score_mean":4.56,"rec_score_mean":4.33,"gem_score_mean":0,"sentiment_score_median":0.5106,"best_gem_comment":"","workload_score_mean":6.22,"best_gem_comment_short":"","best_comment":"Take this class only if you feel uncomfortable with writing.

If you\'re thinking about taking the course, do it! Find some friends to take it with you, clear space in your schedule, and deep dive into the course. It\'s definitely worth it; don\'t be deterred by any reviews. A few reasons the class stands out:1) Stratos and his lab are some of the most chill, yet cracked people I\'ve ever met\u2014just look at the awards they win. This translates to easy\u2013to\u2013understand lectures and a good introduction to research. Lectures teach you how to walk step\u2013by\u2013step through the different operators you learn about, as well as how to break down any high\u2013level database concept into the fundamentals: cache utilization, branching, etc. (I would suggest taking CS 61 before this course; I will note that I found the project easier than the psets in CS 61). Furthermore, doing database research is comparable to the work you do in lectures.2) You learn how to code\u2014independently. Unlike in CS 61, where the projects were contained to 1\u20132 weeks of work, no one besides you in this class (not the TFs nor Stratos) will know your entire database implementation because you\'ll be working on it throughout the semester. Besides the handout code\u2014which you can revamp to your heart\'s content\u2014you decide which functions to create and how they work, how to parse inputs, and how to return results. Attending lectures should provide a rough outline for you to follow, but besides that, you learn how to debug your code. (Please, please, please install Valgrind immediately after starting the course. I promise you\'ll save 2 weeks\' worth of time you\'d otherwise spend debugging weird errors and dealing with memory management in C. You can either launch an EC2 instance or run it through Docker). Modularize your functions, unit test new operators, and spend time thinking about the high\u2013level concepts (you should really only spend 30% of your time on this project actually coding); this project isn\'t bad once you realize how to break a big task into a collection of smaller ones. 3) The grading is very generous with extra credit, namely, on the midterms.

Anatomy consists of Dr. Milberg giving slideshow presentations on various structures/functions of the brain, sometimes using a human brain or a model. It can be easy to get a bit lost in this part of the course, so don\'t be afraid to ask questions. You\'ll also learn the most if you buy the workbook he recommends and actually use it. The anatomy section is tested with a relatively easy midterm. The second segment is group presentations on famous cases of abnormal cognition \u2014 think Phineas Gage, HM, ect. \u2014 that build on some anatomy knowledge but are generally interesting to work on & listen to. The take\u2013home final was based on these cases. Our seminar was also offered an opportunity during reading period to do one last \\"cutting\\" of the brain to access some of the structures we weren\'t able to physically see earlier in the class.\xa0Overall, I\'d highly recommend the course \u2014 it\'s a \'gem\' in it\'s low required workload (again, you get the most if you do work outside of class that\'s not required) BUT it is also extremely interesting. Dr. Milberg is a gem of an instructor. He is incredibly knowledgable, friendly, accessible, and has a lot of interesting personal stories about cases he\'s seen throughout his career. This is a low\u2013stakes way to learn brain anatomy (which is surprisingly lacking in the College\'s neuroscience department) because the workload is very low and Milberg is very willing to entertain questions. Even if anatomy is not the most interesting subject for you (as it wasn\'t for me), examining a real human brain is a unique opportunity that is hard to come by. The cases were also very interesting with a good mix of diversity. I didn\'t think I had retained that much from the anatomy section but I was surprised at how much I actually remembered when we came to the cases.","workload_score_mean":2.2,"best_gem_comment_short":"Overall, I\'d highly recommend the course \u2014 it\'s a \'gem\' in it\'s low required workload (again, you get the most if you do work outside of class that\'s not required) BUT it is also extremely interesting.","course_id":"109866","link":"https://harvard.bluera.com/harvard/rpv-eng.aspx?lang=eng&redi=1&SelectedIDforPrint=c4d23fc548fdf238167bfbff217eb28a498111847b393d0ce1a18dd3bf1e614f411a5d90cb5225cb3b8eb1e0341fce99&ReportType=2&regl=en-US"},{"course_code":"GOV 1737","useful_title":"Evaluating the Impacts of Public Policies How to Design and Implement Randomized Controlled Trials","course_score_mean":4.77,"rec_score_mean":4.69,"gem_score_mean":0.1428571429,"sentiment_score_median":0.8481,"best_gem_comment":"Truly a gem!

I developed a bigger appreciation for classical music but also became able to think about more modern music in a completely new light.2. IT\'S NOT MUCH WORK AND NOT STRESSFUL AT ALL: A true gem. INCREDIBLY interesting lectures and course material, great assignments, also a SUPER polished and organized course. And truly, this course is not very difficult or stressful. Still, I was motivated to do well because the teaching staff is so great, which brings me to...3. THE COURSE STAFF: Oh. my. god. I LOVED my TF in this class (Cana McGhee, she\'s a gem), but the other ones were also SICK. Section was such a joy, had amazing convos, great music listening, and always walked out having Shazam\'d at least 2 new songs.4. MICHAEL UY: This man right here, is just, *chef\'s kiss*. Never have I had a professor so eloquent, enthusiastic, personable, funny, polished, relatable, and SO INTELLIGENT at the same time. Every lecture, every moment of this course was made so enjoyable because of Michael. He also knew everyone\'s name (I\'m talking like 120 people) after the second week.

From sharing fun facts about ourselves at the start of class to watching documentaries on cons, I felt like I learned so much about my classmates and the world in general.

This is simply fact. You will find a great community of students and really welcoming teaching faculty who will assist you in every way they can. Some people might describe this class as scarring yourself with knowledge such that you build scar tissue to protect you from the trauma of future classes at Harvard and beyond, but it is important to remember that this metaphorical scar is composed of learning the most wide array of topics possible for an introductory course and that in and of itself is valuable.  It can help narrow down what you are interested in studying or fill in the gaps of a subject you may have felt initially weak in.  Another benefit is that the speed of learning and organization of this class will likely prepare you for rigorous courses that have plentiful resources and study aids down the line since LS50 is much more amorphous in the material it covers. Regardless, you will have to be dedicated to the pursuit of learning and thinking like a researcher over worrying over the granularity of your grades. If you focus on the minutiae of points, this is not the class for you and you will likely feel that the outcome of this class is not worth the work entailed. The perception of difficulty and  challenge within this course is only natural and there are many points throughout the course where no student has a detailed background in what is being taught, creating a more even playing field. Personally, the second semester has been exponentially easier than the first in terms of psets and exams although it\'s not a complete pushover.  Given that LS50 restricts 5 out of the 8 courses you take within your freshman year, I believe the second semester\'s lowered difficulty will allow you to take on an additional 1 or even 2 courses. With all that said, this class is definitely not for everyone. If you are not interested in exploring the integration of mathematical and physics based components into biology or chemistry, immediately walk away and run in the other direction. Ls1B and LS1A are much better fits for people interested in pure bio and chem. If you are somewhere wavering in between and wondering why this inclusion of math in biology is important or even remotely interesting, it allows you to dive deep into the mechanics of cells and life that are often taken for granted in typical life science courses and presents a useful paradigm for research questions and modeling of biological systems. Personally, I entered this course much more interested in medicine than research but in exiting, I have grown to appreciate research more in tandem with medicine. Deciding to take this course is a pretty huge decision and one that should not be left up to your ego. It\'s important to level your expectations by consulting with a previous student or some members of the teaching faculty but even in cases where expectations were not necessarily aligned with the reality of the course, there is a general consensus of feeling extremely rewarded by all this class has to offer.","best_comment_short":"You will find a great community of students and really welcoming teaching faculty who will assist you in every way they can.","best_comment_first":"LS50 WILL BE THE DEFINING PART OF YOUR FRESHMAN YEAR if you decide to take this course.","course_id":"159707","link":"https://harvard.bluera.com/harvard/rpv-eng.aspx?lang=eng&redi=1&SelectedIDforPrint=58302da63369f8e5375422e81d286e10a71f2fad57897c155d241efee983695b9cc16eb035ac9907e2ae98acf49cd17d&ReportType=2&regl=en-US"},{"course_code":"HAA 42P","useful_title":"Architecture through the Ages Notre-Dame-de-Paris","course_score_mean":4.6,"rec_score_mean":4.63,"gem_score_mean":0,"sentiment_score_median":0.9106,"best_gem_comment":"","workload_score_mean":4.6,"best_gem_comment_short":"","best_comment":"Fantastic HAA course.

As I age and mature, I find myself a little less pliable, elasticity slowly bowing to rigidity. And yet, this class was a belonging space for me and a resounding one at that. In my PhD program my writing had been everything but handled tenderly. I\u2019m under no delusion that my writing doesn\u2019t need work; however, I\u2019ve never been in a space where we are so strongly encouraged to find the good, the cors and to make a piece the best version of itself not your best version. Academia has largely severed my connection with writing although it was my lifeblood as an introverted child working through what I now recognize as trauma. I\u2019ve gradually lost my connection to the sustaining power of this art, compounding my pain. This class has begun to mend that relationship. It\u2019s forced me to see the good in my own work. It\u2019s pushed me to offer myself the same tenderness that I seek to offer others.Within the first few classes, if not the first class, Meng was able to invite us into a space where not only were we affirmed, but so too was our writing. The writing exercises early on both excited and intimidated me. Watching the ink spread on my page gave form and life to my ideas. So many of them have gone untilled, unattended that it seemed impossible to ever watch them flower and fruit. Within the greenhouse of our classroom, as I released my cors into the atmosphere and so did my peers, our gifts collided, thickened, and nourished us all. I\u2019ve learned so much from this class. Let the erotic lead you to the \u201cI.\u201d Continually asking myself, \u201cwhat comes through the hole?,\u201d diverging from tropes and detouring from the paths our minds try to take us for a more excellent way, and, of course, \u201ctell, don\u2019t show.\u201d But even beyond these, the hardest lesson Meng has taught is the importance (and challenge) of writing the good. the beautiful. the delightful. I must admit, this is a lesson that I will be learning for the rest of my life, but it\u2019s one of which I\u2019m beginning to appreciate the value. I really needed this class. It has done more for me than I can adequately express.

This isn\'t really the worst thing \u2013 the textbook is wonderful in my opinion \u2013 but it makes the value proposition of a 9am lecture not great. Similarly for sections. That being said, I went to CA office hours regularly (shoutout to David and Christine) and found a ton of support and camaraderie in the class.The psets are a good mix too. I personally like the probability side of the class (i.e. Poisson processes, Brownian motion, Ito calculus) far more than the computational side (Markov chains, Metropolis\u2013Hastings, etc.), so I enjoyed the latter half of the class exponentially more than the front half. The first couple psets are quite bashy, and the fourth pset on MCMC is literally all in R (you should be ready to learn R, because you\'ll be using it liberally), but the rest are generally fine, and often quite elegant.Finally, the exams are hard, and they\'re a big chunk of your grade. If I had known how hard, I would have seriously considered not taking the class \u2013 unlike the psets, which are almost entirely textbook questions, the exams are hard because you have to apply course concepts in ways that were really never explained or described in lecture/section. If you\'re not used to that (for ref., lots of people in the course took stat 210 before this or are upperclassmen stats concentrators), the exams will be hard \u2013 I\'m a potential math concentrator who took three other math/stat classes, and they definitely were my hardest exams.

First of all, Prof. Auroux is wonderful. He\'s incredibly accessible and cares about making sure people are doing well. He is going to be in France next year, but I\'m sure whoever is teaching 55 in 2022\u20132023 will be great! The material is really beautiful (although you can certainly have more of a taste for certain things than others), and it feels ever\u2013so\u2013slightly more chill than 55A.The material is honestly quite interesting. Topology \u2013 and especially algebraic topology\xa0\u2013 is a fundamental discipline to basically anything, and Auroux\'s presentation of complex analysis is very good for getting you to appreciate just how beautiful of a subject it is. Full disclosure, I am not the biggest analysis fan \u2013 I liked alg top far more \u2013 and I didn\'t have any experience with real analysis. Yet, often during the two weeks we talked about real analysis, there was a general sentiment of \\"yeah this is all stuff we should know.\\" The point being: this class is technically an introduction to all these fields, but unless you\'re ready and willing to make it the center of your spring semester, it won\'t be a very comfortable introduction.The psets were also generally fun. There were some questions that definitely should have been marked as challenge problems that were simply not, but beyond that they were good. Do start psets early, or at least look at them early \u2013 it takes time for things to sit and be mulled over in your head! The exams can be a big source of stress, but I think they were generally easier than in 55A \u2013 analysis at this level is often \\"done on autopilot,\\" in that there\'s only so many tricks you can try before something ends up working. Overall, try to stay on top of the material \u2013 it is much harder than you expect to catch up if you fall behind, speaking from experience.On the other hand, the class environment in 55B is... less than stellar. Your best hope is to find a good group of people to pset with that aren\'t magnets for drama, but in my case, there was so much drama going on that I didn\'t go to lecture for a very long time. 55 attracts a very specific kind of person \u2013 generally, people who enjoy suffering, or enjoy watching other suffer around them, and people who, as mathematicians, haven\'t quite mellowed out from the cutthroat, competitive, and prestige\u2013centric attitude that high school math things breed. If I could have taken the class entirely remotely, I probably would have.So, should you take 55B? First, I don\'t think 55A is a strict prerequisite, but definitely a soft one \u2013 the familiarity with group theory is essential for alg top. And as my experience goes, I think there\'s basically no barrier to entry, save for how much time you\'re ready to put into it. If you want math to be the center of your spring semester, then go for it. If not, then take 25B or 22B, or whatever is best for you (you\'ll quickly realize that if prestige is what you\'re shooting for, your mental and physical wellbeing are high costs to pay for it). In any case, good luck with your decision and whatever you choose to do!","best_comment_short":"The material is really beautiful (although you can certainly have more of a taste for certain things than others), and it feels ever\u2013so\u2013slightly more chill than 55A.The material is honestly quite interesting.","best_comment_first":"Math 55B was a very interesting course.","course_id":"112871","link":"https://harvard.bluera.com/harvard/rpv-eng.aspx?lang=eng&redi=1&SelectedIDforPrint=1af56bc14b1ced2eb0a233db1f648addea9bbe054e39d544db23c3b375ace0acf27ef9d46b1d84a94f9180f2dd3e0854&ReportType=2&regl=en-US"},{"course_code":"EXPOS 40","useful_title":"Public Speaking Practicum","course_score_mean":4.7,"rec_score_mean":4.8,"gem_score_mean":0,"sentiment_score_median":0.9244,"best_gem_comment":"","workload_score_mean":3.8,"best_gem_comment_short":"","best_comment":"Your experience is very dependent on who your section leader is.

The material is so insanely well taught. Wes\'s strength is in analysis so he motivates examples and provides intuition really well. The lectures are very good, and he answers all questions during the lectures. However, this results in the fact that most classes end around five minutes over time, and additional videos may be posted if the material isn\'t completely covered. Also, this class was a 9AM three times a week (with no recordings), so just make sure you\'re prepared for this. The community is really great, and many students in this class actually did not come from a high school math background but were more so interested in fields that require knowledge of real analysis. Because of this, a collaborative environment was fostered. I think it\'s really important to find people to pset with, if not the most important. Definitely definitely attend Wes\'s office hours. He is an amazing professor but also such a kind person, and it\'s very nice to get to know him! He can also clarify gaps in your knowledge about lecture material. For psets, I think it\'s more helpful to go to the CAs office hours since you can collaborate with students, but Wes gives great intuition behind how to solve the problems. This class is extremely rewarding, in my opinion, if you put in the time. Because the psets are not graded harshly, it felt that a lot of my energy was spent truly learning the material instead of perfecting pset solutions like in some other classes. Overall, this class is tough but rewarding.

This class is accessible to a fairly wide range of math backgrounds, has a good balance of definitions and interesting results (i.e. not too many of the former and plenty of the latter), and the problem solving on the PSets and exams is mostly satisfying. I\'ll now get into more detail about what I felt were this class\' pros and cons.Pros:\u2013 Lectures. Dr. Balibanu does an amazing job explaining difficult concepts so that everyone can understand them. Coming from a limited math background (only previous math courses were 21a/b, with some proof\u2013writing experience), I was somewhat apprehensive about my level of preparation for the class. The most out of place I ever felt was occasionally when she would ask, \\"who here has at least heard of concept X,\\" to which most of the class excluding me raised their hands. However, she would go on to then clearly explain the concept and how it related to the material at hand. Despite my minimal prior math experience, I found the lectures very clear and easy to follow. This was especially evident when trying to self\u2013teach myself the concepts from textbooks \u2013\u2013 the lectures were significantly easier to learn from.\u2013 Course content. Obviously this is very subjective, but complex analysis lies at the intersection of many areas of math wherein many interesting results are fairly easily accessible, without needing to get bogged down in too many definitions. The class is at face value an extension of multivariable calculus to the complex numbers, and it provides very nice ways to think about otherwise difficult problems such as the fundamental theorem of algebra, certain real\u2013valued integrals and infinite sums, and the Riemann zeta function. It is clear that the concepts of complex analysis are very useful for future areas in math, but even if you\'re not planning on continuing to study math, they are also pretty fun to learn/think about in and of themselves.\u2013 Course staff. As previously mentioned, Dr. Balibanu is a great lecturer. She is also generally very accessible in office hours and in Slack, and the TFs are similarly helpful, especially in the resources and review sessions they have before tests.\u2013 Grading. The grading for this course is half PSets and half exams. The PSets can be tricky and occasionally take a while, but office hours are great in helping to get through them, and they are graded leniently. The exams are very fair \u2013\u2013 the problems are often easier versions of those from the PSets, and lots of points are given just for remembering definitions (btw \u2013\u2013 when studying, make sure to know all the results, especially those with names).Cons:\u2013 Course materials. Outside of lecture, the only real supplementary course resource is the textbook which, as I previously mentioned, can be difficult to learn from. This is fine if you go to all the lectures and take good notes, but there are no lecture notes/recordings to help catch you up to speed if you don\'t (though this was Dr. Balibanu\'s first iteration of the course, so maybe this will change).\u2013 Feedback. The only feedback given is the PSet and exam grades. The exams were graded pretty quickly, which was appreciated. However, the PSets often took many weeks to be returned, which especially mattered given that there were (generally) no PSet solutions available other than by going to TFs during office hours and asking for explanations.\u2013 Computational homework problems. The PSets were a mix of conceptual and computational problems. While the conceptual problems were generally good concept review, the computational problems sometimes became tedious and felt like busywork.","best_comment_short":"It is clear that the concepts of complex analysis are very useful for future areas in math, but even if you\'re not planning on continuing to study math, they are also pretty fun to learn/think about in and of themselves.\u2013 Course staff.","best_comment_first":"Overall, this is a great class \u2013\u2013 if you are at all interested in theoretical math and especially if it is still being taught by Dr. Balibanu, definitely take it.","course_id":"113608","link":"https://harvard.bluera.com/harvard/rpv-eng.aspx?lang=eng&redi=1&SelectedIDforPrint=e3fcf59b25cb7523a5778751dbb08c92a4fe7bc67e90061e898cdf99b8caa9c0fc4b5878ad11c978f0e74e92a0ef82db&ReportType=2&regl=en-US"},{"course_code":"HISTSCI 99B","useful_title":"Tutorial - Senior Year","course_score_mean":4.39,"rec_score_mean":4.55,"gem_score_mean":0,"sentiment_score_median":0.7835,"best_gem_comment":"","workload_score_mean":14.89,"best_gem_comment_short":"","best_comment":"Writing a thesis was super rewarding and I highly recommend it!!!

While I really liked the teaching staff, it did feel pretty chaotic and disorganized most of the time. This class was the most \\"english\\" class I have taken so far \u2014 nearly every other sentence was a reference to a canonical piece that I had not read so I often felt pretty out of my wheelhouse.

So often class was just talking about random (although interesting) things that weren\'t always super central to the text. The assignments were pretty flexible though \u2014 up to two creative assignments out of four total.
