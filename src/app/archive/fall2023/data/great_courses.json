I personally really loved the class. Material: A large emphasis is on ecological modeling,  but if you're into medicine or biochemistry, the topics will also flow throughout the course. There are also concepts that come from human anatomy (either in papers like epidermal wounds, leukemia modeling, cardiac electrophysiology) that are introduced through a mathematical lens and changed my way of viewing processes like heartbeats, healing, and medication.Lecture: Honestly it is so useful when it comes to reviewing the steps you need to approach in solving a problem set question. Go to every class and write down everything Wes puts on the board, even if it takes a minute to understand. It might click as you work through problems.Problem sets: They're only once a week, which is so much better than Math 21a and 21b. If you're between this class and Math 22a or 22b, I'd select 19a if you don't have experience with proofs. Also office hours were helpful because the TFs are patient and will guide you as you approach questions. Show up even if you barely started.Exams: It's nice that there are only two. It's scary that they cover so much content. One thing that caught me off guard is that your understanding of the readings is also asked. It's nothing tricky or too specific. If you take notes while Todd presents the key points in the article and later review his lecture slides (which contain more notes on Canvas) then you'll be ready. As for the math portion, make sure you know the rationale behind what certain topics are and not just the steps, because some questions will not be so simple as to just memorize the steps and write them down.Final Project: Start early!! Your proposal is due sometime in mid\u2013October. If you're learning about a certain concept in LS1a, LPS A, or another life sciences adjacent class, pick your favorite and find some math behind it. This way, it feels more interesting as you learn more and study for your other class. As long as you begin graphing models (at least one graph) before Thanksgiving break and continue before\/throughout reading period, you'll be fine.Always reach out to Wes! He's a great person to talk to and genuinely is rooting for everyone's success. If his office hours don't work for you, reach out for an appointment!

My class came from a variety of the graduate schools, and even undergrad students had diverse interests and reasons for learning Japanese. I came in without having learned Japanese before, and although the learning curve initially is a bit higher than those who have been exposed to the language previously, I truly did not feel hindered or at a disadvantage. This was the most well\u2013thought out, well\u2013planned, course I have ever taken. You will be amazed at how much you learn each week. The quality and joy for learning that Kageyama sensei and our awesome TFs nurtured throughout lecture and section was truly incredible. Another important aspect of the course to note is that there is an abundance of additional resources that perfectly align with the course on the Canvas page. Take advantage of them! The textbook and accompanying app for audio (you can download it for free) matched lecture perfectly and were excellently prepared as well. I have never felt so supported in a course and unlike other courses where the book or reference material doesn't match class, all the units are very systematic and if you ever get confused or need clarification, the book is guaranteed to have the answers to your questions. The course staff also holds \"Nihongo Chat Hours\" every week if you want more practice speaking or just one\u2013on\u2013one time to review. The course is one you need to dedicate time to, but it will be a rewarding and fun experience. You'll see how deeply Kageyama sensei and your TFs are dedicated toward giving you an authentic, rigorous, and eye\u2013opening experience in learning Japanese language and culture. They are some of the most professional and caring course staff I have had the pleasure of working with, and it shows in how much all of us in class felt we wanted to do our very best for them. Overall, taking Japan BA was an invaluable experience and it's one of those courses that has deeply impacted my continued interest in Japan and for other cultures in general.","best_comment_short":"The quality and joy for learning that Kageyama sensei and our awesome TFs nurtured throughout lecture and section was truly incredible.","best_comment_first":"I would highly recommend Japan BA if you are interested in learning Japanese.","course_id":"111193","link":"https:\/\/harvard.bluera.com\/harvard\/rpv-eng.aspx?lang=eng&redi=1&SelectedIDforPrint=a6fc492e3b6c6c430928a65890abffc8b5dc5f8d3a9f1e946ada6c8b626bd4c426166413629489a6f1af29daf758aedc&ReportType=2&regl=en-US"},{"course_code":"ENGLISH 90QM","useful_title":"Metaphysical Poetry The Seventeenth-Century Lyric and Beyond","course_score_mean":4.55,"rec_score_mean":4.55,"gem_score_mean":0.0,"sentiment_score_median":0.91,"best_gem_comment":"","workload_score_mean":3.5,"best_gem_comment_short":"","best_comment":"This is a very good course for those who want an introduction to metaphysical poetry (and even to poetry generally).

I was just scared, like it seems like many people are. This class fixed all of that\u2013\u2013and more! In Kate's tremendous section, I grew to have a confidence not only with speaking but also with sharing my inner voice with other people. Through a poetry class at Harvard, I had already learned how to put my thoughts onto paper. Yet never had I felt comfortable saying them out loud to other people, let alone standing at the front of a big room with many people and commanding attention to tell a story or message. That was completely new!I leave the class confident in my voice, and I feel the effects every day, whether I'm talking with friends, at clubs, with family, or in professional settings at work. The confidence of a Harvard\u2013educated public speaker, maybe?  Who knows. Yet somehow the class really did transform my attitude toward myself and what I can do, so long as I prepare adequately, through its experience\u2013based four speeches over the course of the semester, combined with weekly student and instructor feedback. During class sessions, the class can feel like what I imagine a theater class can feel like: fun, varied warm ups,  a spirit of \"YES! And?.\" It's no surprise, given that my preceptor, Katy, seems to have spent a lot of time with a Shakespeare company. But that type of class structure and thinking, so refreshing to someone with a more technical, stem\/finance background, really opened me up to a new way of thinking. Our class got so close, over the course of the semester, that we all went thrifting with each other in our free time\u2013\u2013twice! This class is definitely a no brainer.

Chem major or not (if you need to take orgo for pre\u2013med for example), take this class!! Professor Myers is a wonderful lecturer and the teaching staff is great. This course is definitely difficult and will require a lot of your time. There's no getting around that. There's a lot of material covered and Professor Myers often goes through lectures at a very fast pace (to the point where if someone asks a question, he either advises them to speak with him after class or answers the question but we stay 2\u20133 min late after class because there is just no time). The teaching style worked very well for me, it was a traditional \"professor lectures at the board for 75 min and you take notes\" which I'm used to and sections were great for catching anything I didn't quite get in class. Though Professor Myers may seem intimidating, he really isn't and genuinely wants to get to know students and just teach fun things in organic chemistry. Problem sets were certainly difficult and you can't do them without going to office hours. But it's usually manageable to complete the whole pset after 1  two\u2013hour office hour session if you start the pset beforehand and only come to office hours with questions. I can't speak to how helpful the PSLs are since I didn't go to their office hours after unhelpful experiences in chem 20, but TF office hours were extremely helpful. The teaching staff in general is very supportive and receptive to questions. Exams were sometimes fair, sometimes pretty difficult. You definitely need to study hard for them and you should probably make peace with simply letting the rest of your life take a backseat the 5\u20137 days before exams. There is however an alternative grading scheme which drops your lowest exam and replaces it with your final exam score which can help if you had a rough time with one of the exams (this was Exam 3 for most people this semester).  Lecture Integration problems were great for reviewing material that was covered recently and keeping it fresh, and they're basically free points (add up to an extra pset grade and they're grade based on completion) so do them!! Also PLEASE go to review sessions! They are \"optional\" in the syllabus (attendance isn't checked) but they are so great for reviewing the material and working on problems to really cement your understanding of the material. Professor Myers takes time out of his schedule to host the review sessions and works through the problems with students at the board which is incredibly helpful ( a little embarrassing sometimes if you are standing at the board for 20 minutes as your synthesis is being reworked, but SO helpful!!). Exam questions are also sometimes pulled STRAIGHT from the review session packets so at the very least go to them to be prepared for potential exam questions. The final was very fair (this year and in years prior since previous finals are given to us as practice finals) and I feel like represented the course material and the class itself quite well. You have to study a lot and put the work in, but it is certainly possible to get very high grades on exams and psets and be very successful in the class. Lab was alright, 4 hours is tough but the TFs tried to make labs fun and also get us out early which was very very appreciated and made the experience much better than it could have been.

You are left with very important and fundamental proofs done in class or in problem sets or reviewed in the textbook. It is also strongly recommended to LaTeX your psets, which is very helpful when reviewing the psets for the midterms or the final exam, but also takes a lot of time (in my experience, about 5\u20136 per week). The class is VERY well put together and structured. All the problems have a meaning behind and will probably be useful at some later time in the course (go to Wes's office hours to learn the \"meaning\" of each problem).  The reading, unlike other classes, are straightforward and helpful. The lecture notes are too! I strongly recommend not skipping lecture, even though it's a 3 times per week 9am class, since not all lecture videos are uploaded, and by actively participating you learn a lot easier. Also, it is pretty easy to get left behind if you don't attend lectures. One thing that I did not like were the solutions to the psets, which were not quite useful, because they were skipping a lot of steps, and not giving proper explanations. Another thing I really liked was Wes's openness. He was very supportive after the first midterm, and did not release the mean of the exam, which was emotionally helpful for the students's sake. He really emphasized self growth, which I have rarely seen in teachers. I strongly recommend going to his office hours if possible. They are not that useful for solving the pset problems, but for understanding class material, and its usefulness in other areas (Wes is an applied mathematician and gives many examples for applicability of linear algebra).  Also, you get to build a connection with a wonderful faculty member. After the final exam, he said that whether we choose to take 25b or not (which is also his class), he is our supporter, and our adviser throughout our undergraduate experience. He said to reach out whenever we need anything math related. So, to sum up, Math 25a is a hard class, very thoroughly done linear algebra, but which proves to be helpful a lot of areas such as physics, and it is very well structured so that you get through the difficult material easier.","best_comment_short":"Math 25a is a project that you put a lot of work into, but if done correctly (which does not mean good grades, but active participation and interest in the class), is very rewarding.","best_comment_first":"Math 25a is a project that you put a lot of work into, but if done correctly (which does not mean good grades, but active participation and interest in the class), is very rewarding.","course_id":"110808","link":"https:\/\/harvard.bluera.com\/harvard\/rpv-eng.aspx?lang=eng&redi=1&SelectedIDforPrint=3649c0ff5eea522d0c4374ea44623b821d602da60d10bc9b1c346eb0eba72ffb06ba8b31474b745ee2633d2db5d9209d&ReportType=2&regl=en-US"},{"course_code":"SOC-STD 98VW","useful_title":"To Remake the World?

It's a really interesting continuation of the topics that Stat 110 covers but in greater depth and rigor. Reasoning by representation (e.g, proving results by connecting different distributions) is really powerful and interesting, and the measure theoretic foundation that Stat 210 provides makes probability (at least in my opinion) more intuitive but also more rigorous. Problem sets are fair and interesting, and exams are reasonable (the midterm was fair, and the final felt generous \u2013 I know it's been a bit harder in previous years though).Overall, the course feels more like an upper\u2013level undergraduate class compared to a graduate class \u2013 both in content and in enrollment. From what I know, for better or for worse, the course differs a bit from other schools' graduate probability classes: it's less focused on measure theory (e.g., spends less time on rigorous constructions of parts of probability) and more focused on providing intuitive results and explanations. It also at times awkwardly balances between doing analysis (e.g., when proving the CLT) and not doing analysis (e.g., handwaving parts of measure theory and MGFs). I'd definitely still recommend taking some form of analysis before this class \u2013 the class is definitely doable without it, but Math 25\/55\/112 or equivalent makes the course much more understandable (especially when it comes to topics like CLTs and LLNs). Also, taking Math 114 at the same time as this course is underrated \u2013 it makes the measure theory parts of this course so much more understandable, and depending on who teaches Math 114, it'll make the end of that class a whole lot easier too.Last bit because I would've liked to have a review like this when I was looking at the QGuide: I self\u2013studied Stat 110 over the summer by watching the Youtube lectures, doing the psets, and reading the textbook \u2013 in the end, I felt really well\u2013prepared for Stat 210, and I think that it was a good move to take Stat 210. I came from a Math 25 background, and even though Stat 210 can be\/sound a little intimidating, it's definitely doable, and if you already know some probability and like analysis, it's a jump worth considering. On the flip side, if your Stat 110 knowledge isn't fairly solid or you're not too confident in basic probability, Stat 210 will be a bit challenging.

You will learn a ton about World War II and the post\u2013war order, and you will get to learn from Prof. Plokhii which itself is a very special experience given his depth of expertise. Another note: the course is called \"the origins of the Cold War,\" but there isn't too much Cold War\u2013study going on. It's mostly WWII focused,  but your papers can focus on the early Cold War.

The material is engaging, it isn't easy given the higher level concepts, but it definitely is doable alongside other difficult classes.  The weekly work felt a little relentless possibly because OH were scheduled right before the work was due most of the time, so we all ended up cramming a lot of the work into the day before due dates, but the grading is nice, and getting an A is certainly not out of reach for most people. Just pay attention in class, don't get distracted on your computer, go to section, and take advantage of the time with the great course staff! Shubham, Manos, and Demba are gems and this class was fantastic.

I also liked that the course encompassed a fair amount of biodiversity (planarians, axolotls, newts, lizards, stick insects, frogs, mice, zebrafish...), and discussed different strategies of regeneration that these organisms have, as well as similarities across distantly related species. I found the discussions to be really thought\u2013provoking and I've been recommending this class to all my friends.","best_comment_short":"Dr Whited is so enthusiastic and is a wonderful person \u2013\u2013 she conveys her excitement for regeneration so well, and all the discussions were fascinating.","best_comment_first":"Take this class!","course_id":"212688","link":"https:\/\/harvard.bluera.com\/harvard\/rpv-eng.aspx?lang=eng&redi=1&SelectedIDforPrint=29352d15957cc9f9f231b07f1a431ea0b0322b27107e2256103151f557fe1e37439b5919fc4d9bd70d7a1c98b8d5d736&ReportType=2&regl=en-US"},{"course_code":"WOMGEN 1217","useful_title":"Psychology of the Gendered Body","course_score_mean":4.31,"rec_score_mean":4.23,"gem_score_mean":0.0,"sentiment_score_median":0.8961,"best_gem_comment":"","workload_score_mean":3.92,"best_gem_comment_short":"","best_comment":"This class is amazing and so is Dr. Noll.

There\u2019s a lot of psychoanalysis, a lot of neoliberalism, some marx, a good amount of sociological theory, etc\u2026 Im very theory pilled, so I loved the readings, but if you aren\u2019t, it might not be the class for you BUT at the same time Tracey helps orient theoretical discussions around the actual happenings of the world, which keeps things grounded and present. I don\u2019t mean to make it sound all theory (it really isn\u2019t!!!), but it\u2019s definitely the most theoretical class I\u2019ve had that still ostensibly about ethnographies and studying particular societal trends.The class is about entrepreneurialism in the loosest of senses. We read about entrepreneurialism in the first week, then we never really discussed it again (which I honestly didn\u2019t mind one bit.) It\u2019s really a class about identity formation under capitalism. And, as mentioned, it is also very theoretical, so ideally for people who like theory and like Freud, Foucault, Butler, etc\u2026 I will also say that though the more theoretical texts DO connect with the more ethnographic readings (which come mainly in the second half) the connections are not always explicitly drawn. My personal only real complaint is that in class presentations from other students were quite long. TLDR; Tracey is a great great teacher, if you like studying theory, psychoanalysis, identity formation, and capitalism as not just an economic system, it\u2019ll probably be a GOAT class, if you don\u2019t, probably still quite good, but know what you\u2019re getting into.","best_comment_short":"And, as mentioned, it is also very theoretical, so ideally for people who like theory and like Freud, Foucault, Butler, etc\u2026 I will also say that though the more theoretical texts DO connect with the more ethnographic readings (which come mainly in the second half) the connections are not always explicitly drawn.","best_comment_first":"This class (or any future class that Tracey is teaching) is objectively very good!","course_id":"220409","link":"https:\/\/harvard.bluera.com\/harvard\/rpv-eng.aspx?lang=eng&redi=1&SelectedIDforPrint=11971f01d5c15736074ee396aad46ba8390edfafc8f1888f13749b5b120edc651fa87fce4777c0bee34888dec8292b90&ReportType=2&regl=en-US"},{"course_code":"WSTAFRCN AA","useful_title":"Elementary West African Pidgin","course_score_mean":4.14,"rec_score_mean":4.64,"gem_score_mean":0.0,"sentiment_score_median":0.7177,"best_gem_comment":"","workload_score_mean":2.77,"best_gem_comment_short":"","best_comment":"I highly recommend this course!

With ASL being new to most students in the class,  Andrew fostered a positive culture around taking risks and having fun.  This course is not a major time suck at all.  Homework never took more than 3 hours in a week other than preparing our final presentation.  Tests are all reasonable, and if you pay attention in class and review a bit you'll find success.  I never found myself stressed  over this class.  I will say that Andrew can be slow to give feedback on videos or emails, so just know that going into the course.

The second major thing I learned is how to understand and react to weekly macroeconomic and financial markets changes: things like new data releases on inflation, the JOLTS survey, BLS data, etc. I most appreciated the opportunity to sit in on Larry's teaching and hear him reason through all the current macro bombs that happened each week, the broader macro questions we were asking, his work on secular stagnation, his take\/explanation on the papers of others, and his live feedback to the students that presented almost every week. This constant exercise of hearing Larry speak and reason through his thoughts and analogies was the MOST valuable takeaway from this course, and would not be received in any other economics experience elsewhere. It was a great privilege to get such constant, consistent, and timely live feedback from Larry and Paul on our presentations, as well as to have them advise us on one paper that we are working towards throughout the entire semester. The weekly student presentations on the papers we read were important as students should have a frequent exercise in the presentation of academic papers; it enforces close engagement with the material, solidifies understanding, and points out areas of confusion. However, most of the papers were over our heads, and it is certain that most students did not have a strong understanding of the academic papers. I wish we had more pedagogical experiences learning to understand these papers from Larry and Paul, after students presented, instead of us trying to make sense of the papers (often the blind leading the blind). If we could increase paper understanding to 80%+, then that would be an incredible achievement and benefit to future students. Lastly, like my peers have said, this course would benefit from an equalization of the floor at the onset of the class by having Larry and Paul teach about foundational macro finance principals in the first few weeks. The students that were not in FED challenge or did not have the privileges of joining FED challenge had a harder learning curve to makeup.","best_comment_short":"It was a great privilege to get such constant, consistent, and timely live feedback from Larry and Paul on our presentations, as well as to have them advise us on one paper that we are working towards throughout the entire semester.","best_comment_first":"To me, one of the most unique and important things I gained from this course is how to think about and explain complex problems with immediately understandable analogies\u2013\u2013this is perhaps the most important general learning tool I have taken away, and it is one of the key hallmarks of Larry's wit and brilliance.","course_id":"217408","link":"https:\/\/harvard.bluera.com\/harvard\/rpv-eng.aspx?lang=eng&redi=1&SelectedIDforPrint=a92c0bae13a5cd87339ae03f91a35f29f79443a30c3b4ba994b0cfb5b91ad29cbf09669b938837d947c4b6a6e7a8bcba&ReportType=2&regl=en-US"},{"course_code":"MUSIC 107","useful_title":"Advanced Ensembles","course_score_mean":5.0,"rec_score_mean":5.0,"gem_score_mean":0.0,"sentiment_score_median":0.6105,"best_gem_comment":"","workload_score_mean":3.13,"best_gem_comment_short":"","best_comment":"Great course if you are in jazz band \u2013 doesn't add a ton of work to your plate and is a good way to learn more about what you are playing within the ensemble.","best_comment_short":"Great course if you are in jazz band \u2013 doesn't add a ton of work to your plate and is a good way to learn more about what you are playing within the ensemble.","best_comment_first":"Great course if you are in jazz band \u2013 doesn't add a ton of work to your plate and is a good way to learn more about what you are playing within the ensemble.","course_id":"220622","link":"https:\/\/harvard.bluera.com\/harvard\/rpv-eng.aspx?lang=eng&redi=1&SelectedIDforPrint=7a7503d91fa136fb70c79747c790085df74f127cf154c7bf70620817ea74e260f914c79148e392fa1158efc77f918df8&ReportType=2&regl=en-US"},{"course_code":"EXPOS 10","useful_title":"Introduction to Expository Writing","course_score_mean":4.56,"rec_score_mean":4.33,"gem_score_mean":0.0,"sentiment_score_median":0.5106,"best_gem_comment":"","workload_score_mean":6.22,"best_gem_comment_short":"","best_comment":"Take this class only if you feel uncomfortable with writing.

If you're thinking about taking the course, do it! Find some friends to take it with you, clear space in your schedule, and deep dive into the course. It's definitely worth it; don't be deterred by any reviews. A few reasons the class stands out:1) Stratos and his lab are some of the most chill, yet cracked people I've ever met\u2014just look at the awards they win. This translates to easy\u2013to\u2013understand lectures and a good introduction to research. Lectures teach you how to walk step\u2013by\u2013step through the different operators you learn about, as well as how to break down any high\u2013level database concept into the fundamentals: cache utilization, branching, etc. (I would suggest taking CS 61 before this course; I will note that I found the project easier than the psets in CS 61). Furthermore, doing database research is comparable to the work you do in lectures.2) You learn how to code\u2014independently. Unlike in CS 61, where the projects were contained to 1\u20132 weeks of work, no one besides you in this class (not the TFs nor Stratos) will know your entire database implementation because you'll be working on it throughout the semester. Besides the handout code\u2014which you can revamp to your heart's content\u2014you decide which functions to create and how they work, how to parse inputs, and how to return results. Attending lectures should provide a rough outline for you to follow, but besides that, you learn how to debug your code. (Please, please, please install Valgrind immediately after starting the course. I promise you'll save 2 weeks' worth of time you'd otherwise spend debugging weird errors and dealing with memory management in C. You can either launch an EC2 instance or run it through Docker). Modularize your functions, unit test new operators, and spend time thinking about the high\u2013level concepts (you should really only spend 30% of your time on this project actually coding); this project isn't bad once you realize how to break a big task into a collection of smaller ones. 3) The grading is very generous with extra credit, namely, on the midterms.
