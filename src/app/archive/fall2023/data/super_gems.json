The essays do not relate to lectures that much, but you should go to lecture so you get the relevant background info.  Essays are not a cake\u2013walk to do well in but if you are thoughtful and go to OH you will be fine. I think this is a perfect, interesting, not too challenging course. I wouldn't call it a gem just because you have to do some work to get an A, but it should not be too bad.","workload_score_mean":4.42,"best_gem_comment_short":"I wouldn't call it a gem just because you have to do some work to get an A, but it should not be too bad.","course_id":"125049","link":"https:\/\/harvard.bluera.com\/harvard\/rpv-eng.aspx?lang=eng&redi=1&SelectedIDforPrint=3fb0817f55cb79e606c4caa02cc1c686c58dc4099dabff980a8ead227e782ac15bc59240646b85a05ed39bbf30377303&ReportType=2&regl=en-US"},{"course_code":"PSY 1201","useful_title":"Your Brain on Drugs Psychopharmacology","course_score_mean":4.61,"rec_score_mean":4.59,"gem_score_mean":0.0272727273,"sentiment_score_median":0.8844,"best_gem_comment":"This class is great. Very low stress, the quizzes are not very difficult if you just read through the lecture slides right before. Midterm was very fair and I did much better than anticipated, and I only studied the day before. The debate was easy even though i despise public speaking. You can make up like up to 6 quizzes or something so even if you miss\/bomb some it's totally chill. Section was super chill, if Diana is still a TF you should try to get her, she rocks! Material is super interesting, even to someone who is not particularly interested in clinical stuff. Also just generally relevant\/good to know info for navigating life. Professor Lukas is super enthusiastic and makes lectures enjoyable and interesting.

If you have any interest in physics, please take this course. Therefore, if you are reading this, please take this course. Physics 19 is an absolute gem of a class, and I promise you will not regret taking it. Professor Barandes is genuinely one of the kindest and wisest teachers I've ever had, and if you do take this course, I encourage you to block out some time to stay after class and simply talk with him. He is incredibly knowledgable and somehow manages to make very complicated and high\u2013level topics understandable for a beginning physics student, or really anybody interested in the topic. Another thing that I think is important to mention is that although this class is many things, it is certainly not a slog at any point. It is fast paced and can definitely be hard to understand sometimes, but Professor Barandes somehow manages to keep everything interesting, and it leaves you wanting to learn more.

It is a gem in a sense that you will learn so much but you will not be extremely stressed out about grades. The grade distribution in the course is amazing. Every aspect is weighed enough so that you have to be consistent in order to do well in the course and your grade is not just reliant on a few test grades. The psets are actually fun and manageable, the course staff are accessible and ready to help or answer questions.
