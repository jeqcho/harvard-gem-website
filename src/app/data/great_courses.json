This is simply fact. You will find a great community of students and really welcoming teaching faculty who will assist you in every way they can. Some people might describe this class as scarring yourself with knowledge such that you build scar tissue to protect you from the trauma of future classes at Harvard and beyond, but it is important to remember that this metaphorical scar is composed of learning the most wide array of topics possible for an introductory course and that in and of itself is valuable.  It can help narrow down what you are interested in studying or fill in the gaps of a subject you may have felt initially weak in.  Another benefit is that the speed of learning and organization of this class will likely prepare you for rigorous courses that have plentiful resources and study aids down the line since LS50 is much more amorphous in the material it covers. Regardless, you will have to be dedicated to the pursuit of learning and thinking like a researcher over worrying over the granularity of your grades. If you focus on the minutiae of points, this is not the class for you and you will likely feel that the outcome of this class is not worth the work entailed. The perception of difficulty and  challenge within this course is only natural and there are many points throughout the course where no student has a detailed background in what is being taught, creating a more even playing field. Personally, the second semester has been exponentially easier than the first in terms of psets and exams although it's not a complete pushover.  Given that LS50 restricts 5 out of the 8 courses you take within your freshman year, I believe the second semester's lowered difficulty will allow you to take on an additional 1 or even 2 courses. With all that said, this class is definitely not for everyone. If you are not interested in exploring the integration of mathematical and physics based components into biology or chemistry, immediately walk away and run in the other direction. Ls1B and LS1A are much better fits for people interested in pure bio and chem. If you are somewhere wavering in between and wondering why this inclusion of math in biology is important or even remotely interesting, it allows you to dive deep into the mechanics of cells and life that are often taken for granted in typical life science courses and presents a useful paradigm for research questions and modeling of biological systems. Personally, I entered this course much more interested in medicine than research but in exiting, I have grown to appreciate research more in tandem with medicine. Deciding to take this course is a pretty huge decision and one that should not be left up to your ego. It's important to level your expectations by consulting with a previous student or some members of the teaching faculty but even in cases where expectations were not necessarily aligned with the reality of the course, there is a general consensus of feeling extremely rewarded by all this class has to offer.","best_comment_short":"You will find a great community of students and really welcoming teaching faculty who will assist you in every way they can.","best_comment_first":"LS50 WILL BE THE DEFINING PART OF YOUR FRESHMAN YEAR if you decide to take this course.","course_id":"159707","link":"https:\/\/harvard.bluera.com\/harvard\/rpv-eng.aspx?lang=eng&redi=1&SelectedIDforPrint=58302da63369f8e5375422e81d286e10a71f2fad57897c155d241efee983695b9cc16eb035ac9907e2ae98acf49cd17d&ReportType=2&regl=en-US"},{"course_code":"HAA 42P","useful_title":"Architecture through the Ages: Notre-Dame-de-Paris","course_score_mean":4.6,"rec_score_mean":4.63,"gem_score_mean":0.0,"sentiment_score_median":0.9106,"best_gem_comment":"","workload_score_mean":4.6,"best_gem_comment_short":"","best_comment":"Fantastic HAA course.

Prof. Hopkins is an incredible lecturer, and I highly recommend going to the lectures (no matter who teaches it next semester). Even though is is really busy (being the head of the math dept.), he makes time for his 231 students and his office hours are very fun! Also, Sanath Devalapurkar, our CA, is great; he's super helpful, accessible, and does a good job complementing Prof. Hopkins' perspectives.The material in this class is very beautiful... if abstract homotopy theory is your thing. I'd recommend having a working knowledge of category theory (i.e. going through Riehl's Category Theory in Context ch. 1\u20134 would be slightly overkill, but the definitions in those chapters shouldn't be unfamiliar), and a good familiarity with the computations of (co)homology.  The material definitely starts off deceptively slow, but by the time we got to spectral sequences, things were moving at a good pace. Just be prepared to be doing algebra and not geometry \u2013 that's what Paul Seidel's 18.906 is for (so I've heard). There are tons of typos in the lecture notes\/psets, but as a class, we put the lecture notes on overleaf, so we would all go through and correct things \u2013 some students even added substantial exposition of things they found confusing or interesting, which was super helpful! The psets are really interesting though, and aren't a lot of work \u2013 I wouldn't get started the day they're due, because it can take some time to think about, but they're not bad at all.Overall, this class has a lot of community, very cool material, and teaches you some useful life skills (like how to use the Serre spectral sequence and the basics of \u221e\u2013categories, which are objectively useful life skills in math).

The material is really beautiful (at times), and if you have the bandwidth for it, you should definitely consider it!I took this as a fifth class (not the biggest mistake but whatever), and didn't really go to lecture.

This isn't really the worst thing \u2013 the textbook is wonderful in my opinion \u2013 but it makes the value proposition of a 9am lecture not great. Similarly for sections. That being said, I went to CA office hours regularly (shoutout to David and Christine) and found a ton of support and camaraderie in the class.The psets are a good mix too. I personally like the probability side of the class (i.e. Poisson processes, Brownian motion, Ito calculus) far more than the computational side (Markov chains, Metropolis\u2013Hastings, etc.), so I enjoyed the latter half of the class exponentially more than the front half. The first couple psets are quite bashy, and the fourth pset on MCMC is literally all in R (you should be ready to learn R, because you'll be using it liberally), but the rest are generally fine, and often quite elegant.Finally, the exams are hard, and they're a big chunk of your grade. If I had known how hard, I would have seriously considered not taking the class \u2013 unlike the psets, which are almost entirely textbook questions, the exams are hard because you have to apply course concepts in ways that were really never explained or described in lecture\/section. If you're not used to that (for ref., lots of people in the course took stat 210 before this or are upperclassmen stats concentrators), the exams will be hard \u2013 I'm a potential math concentrator who took three other math\/stat classes, and they definitely were my hardest exams. Even having them be open\u2013book exams was not nearly as much help as you'd think. If you're down to learn the material, don't let the exams discourage you.

First of all, Prof. Auroux is wonderful. He's incredibly accessible and cares about making sure people are doing well. He is going to be in France next year, but I'm sure whoever is teaching 55 in 2022\u20132023 will be great! The material is really beautiful (although you can certainly have more of a taste for certain things than others), and it feels ever\u2013so\u2013slightly more chill than 55A.The material is honestly quite interesting. Topology \u2013 and especially algebraic topology\u00a0\u2013 is a fundamental discipline to basically anything, and Auroux's presentation of complex analysis is very good for getting you to appreciate just how beautiful of a subject it is. Full disclosure, I am not the biggest analysis fan \u2013 I liked alg top far more \u2013 and I didn't have any experience with real analysis. Yet, often during the two weeks we talked about real analysis, there was a general sentiment of \"yeah this is all stuff we should know.\" The point being: this class is technically an introduction to all these fields, but unless you're ready and willing to make it the center of your spring semester, it won't be a very comfortable introduction.The psets were also generally fun. There were some questions that definitely should have been marked as challenge problems that were simply not, but beyond that they were good. Do start psets early, or at least look at them early \u2013 it takes time for things to sit and be mulled over in your head! The exams can be a big source of stress, but I think they were generally easier than in 55A \u2013 analysis at this level is often \"done on autopilot,\" in that there's only so many tricks you can try before something ends up working. Overall, try to stay on top of the material \u2013 it is much harder than you expect to catch up if you fall behind, speaking from experience.On the other hand, the class environment in 55B is... less than stellar. Your best hope is to find a good group of people to pset with that aren't magnets for drama, but in my case, there was so much drama going on that I didn't go to lecture for a very long time. 55 attracts a very specific kind of person \u2013 generally, people who enjoy suffering, or enjoy watching other suffer around them, and people who, as mathematicians, haven't quite mellowed out from the cutthroat, competitive, and prestige\u2013centric attitude that high school math things breed. If I could have taken the class entirely remotely, I probably would have.So, should you take 55B? First, I don't think 55A is a strict prerequisite, but definitely a soft one \u2013 the familiarity with group theory is essential for alg top. And as my experience goes, I think there's basically no barrier to entry, save for how much time you're ready to put into it. If you want math to be the center of your spring semester, then go for it. If not, then take 25B or 22B, or whatever is best for you (you'll quickly realize that if prestige is what you're shooting for, your mental and physical wellbeing are high costs to pay for it). In any case, good luck with your decision and whatever you choose to do!","best_comment_short":"The material is really beautiful (although you can certainly have more of a taste for certain things than others), and it feels ever\u2013so\u2013slightly more chill than 55A.The material is honestly quite interesting.","best_comment_first":"Math 55B was a very interesting course.","course_id":"112871","link":"https:\/\/harvard.bluera.com\/harvard\/rpv-eng.aspx?lang=eng&redi=1&SelectedIDforPrint=1af56bc14b1ced2eb0a233db1f648addea9bbe054e39d544db23c3b375ace0acf27ef9d46b1d84a94f9180f2dd3e0854&ReportType=2&regl=en-US"},{"course_code":"EXPOS 40","useful_title":"Public Speaking Practicum 001","course_score_mean":4.7,"rec_score_mean":4.8,"gem_score_mean":0.0,"sentiment_score_median":0.9244,"best_gem_comment":"","workload_score_mean":3.8,"best_gem_comment_short":"","best_comment":"Your experience is very dependent on who your section leader is.

The material is so insanely well taught. Wes's strength is in analysis so he motivates examples and provides intuition really well. The lectures are very good, and he answers all questions during the lectures.

Also, this class was a 9AM three times a week (with no recordings), so just make sure you're prepared for this. The community is really great, and many students in this class actually did not come from a high school math background but were more so interested in fields that require knowledge of real analysis. Because of this, a collaborative environment was fostered. I think it's really important to find people to pset with, if not the most important. Definitely definitely attend Wes's office hours. He is an amazing professor but also such a kind person, and it's very nice to get to know him! He can also clarify gaps in your knowledge about lecture material. For psets, I think it's more helpful to go to the CAs office hours since you can collaborate with students, but Wes gives great intuition behind how to solve the problems. This class is extremely rewarding, in my opinion, if you put in the time. Because the psets are not graded harshly, it felt that a lot of my energy was spent truly learning the material instead of perfecting pset solutions like in some other classes.

This class is accessible to a fairly wide range of math backgrounds, has a good balance of definitions and interesting results (i.e. not too many of the former and plenty of the latter), and the problem solving on the PSets and exams is mostly satisfying. I'll now get into more detail about what I felt were this class' pros and cons.Pros:\u2013 Lectures. Dr. Balibanu does an amazing job explaining difficult concepts so that everyone can understand them. Coming from a limited math background (only previous math courses were 21a\/b, with some proof\u2013writing experience), I was somewhat apprehensive about my level of preparation for the class. The most out of place I ever felt was occasionally when she would ask, \"who here has at least heard of concept X,\" to which most of the class excluding me raised their hands. However, she would go on to then clearly explain the concept and how it related to the material at hand. Despite my minimal prior math experience, I found the lectures very clear and easy to follow. This was especially evident when trying to self\u2013teach myself the concepts from textbooks \u2013\u2013 the lectures were significantly easier to learn from.\u2013 Course content. Obviously this is very subjective, but complex analysis lies at the intersection of many areas of math wherein many interesting results are fairly easily accessible, without needing to get bogged down in too many definitions. The class is at face value an extension of multivariable calculus to the complex numbers, and it provides very nice ways to think about otherwise difficult problems such as the fundamental theorem of algebra, certain real\u2013valued integrals and infinite sums, and the Riemann zeta function. It is clear that the concepts of complex analysis are very useful for future areas in math, but even if you're not planning on continuing to study math, they are also pretty fun to learn\/think about in and of themselves.\u2013 Course staff. As previously mentioned, Dr. Balibanu is a great lecturer. She is also generally very accessible in office hours and in Slack, and the TFs are similarly helpful, especially in the resources and review sessions they have before tests.\u2013 Grading. The grading for this course is half PSets and half exams. The PSets can be tricky and occasionally take a while, but office hours are great in helping to get through them, and they are graded leniently. The exams are very fair \u2013\u2013 the problems are often easier versions of those from the PSets, and lots of points are given just for remembering definitions (btw \u2013\u2013 when studying, make sure to know all the results, especially those with names).Cons:\u2013 Course materials. Outside of lecture, the only real supplementary course resource is the textbook which, as I previously mentioned, can be difficult to learn from. This is fine if you go to all the lectures and take good notes, but there are no lecture notes\/recordings to help catch you up to speed if you don't (though this was Dr. Balibanu's first iteration of the course, so maybe this will change).\u2013 Feedback. The only feedback given is the PSet and exam grades. The exams were graded pretty quickly, which was appreciated. However, the PSets often took many weeks to be returned, which especially mattered given that there were (generally) no PSet solutions available other than by going to TFs during office hours and asking for explanations.\u2013 Computational homework problems. The PSets were a mix of conceptual and computational problems. While the conceptual problems were generally good concept review, the computational problems sometimes became tedious and felt like busywork.","best_comment_short":"It is clear that the concepts of complex analysis are very useful for future areas in math, but even if you're not planning on continuing to study math, they are also pretty fun to learn\/think about in and of themselves.\u2013 Course staff.","best_comment_first":"Overall, this is a great class \u2013\u2013 if you are at all interested in theoretical math and especially if it is still being taught by Dr. Balibanu, definitely take it.","course_id":"113608","link":"https:\/\/harvard.bluera.com\/harvard\/rpv-eng.aspx?lang=eng&redi=1&SelectedIDforPrint=e3fcf59b25cb7523a5778751dbb08c92a4fe7bc67e90061e898cdf99b8caa9c0fc4b5878ad11c978f0e74e92a0ef82db&ReportType=2&regl=en-US"},{"course_code":"HBTM 200","useful_title":"Pathology of Human Disease","course_score_mean":4.42,"rec_score_mean":4.33,"gem_score_mean":0.0,"sentiment_score_median":0.7096,"best_gem_comment":"","workload_score_mean":3.09,"best_gem_comment_short":"","best_comment":"This class is both interesting and inspiring!

While I really liked the teaching staff, it did feel pretty chaotic and disorganized most of the time. This class was the most \"english\" class I have taken so far \u2014 nearly every other sentence was a reference to a canonical piece that I had not read so I often felt pretty out of my wheelhouse. That being said, it was an environment very open to questions which was nice. The structure of the class was to bring a prepared question to class and that will be the jumping off point for discussion. So often class was just talking about random (although interesting) things that weren't always super central to the text. The assignments were pretty flexible though \u2014 up to two creative assignments out of four total.
