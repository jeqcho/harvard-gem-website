If you actually want to use this course to become better at public speaking (as you should), then know that this is just like any other skill. If you work hard and go beyond the demands of the assignments, you will improve a lot and gain a lot as a speaker. If you do what you need to do to get by you will not gain much from the course. I think that if you just want to take a gem, don't waste spots for other people who might take real advantage of this amazing opportunity and go for the Greek Hero or something :)Also, Lee Nishri\u2013Howitt is an amazing instructor. He has fine\u2013tuned senses to see where different issues are coming from and has some unique and helpful fixes to them. He also creates a welcoming class environment and is very non\u2013judgmental. IDK about other instructors, but Lee is the bees knees. :)","workload_score_mean":3.5,"best_gem_comment_short":"Everyone speaks about how it's great and a gem so I'll spare you those details.","best_comment_first":"Everyone speaks about how it's great and a gem so I'll spare you those details.","best_comment_short":"I think that if you just want to take a gem, don't waste spots for other people who might take real advantage of this amazing opportunity and go for the Greek Hero or something :)Also, Lee Nishri\u2013Howitt is an amazing instructor.","course_id":"125227","link":"https:\/\/harvard.bluera.com\/harvard\/rpv-eng.aspx?lang=eng&redi=1&SelectedIDforPrint=bd2b01da36387d9d910b1e3d52ddbf1b6015ad4b750c08a70cf45420d3dd1cdfe8b76cc4063ce28b2ac5fd436cd6848c&ReportType=2&regl=en-US"}]
