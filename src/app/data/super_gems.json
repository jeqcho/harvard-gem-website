    "best_gem_comment": "The course is split into two sections: anatomy and cases/project presentations. Anatomy consists of Dr. Milberg giving slideshow presentations on various structures/functions of the brain, sometimes using a human brain or a model. It can be easy to get a bit lost in this part of the course, so don't be afraid to ask questions. You'll also learn the most if you buy the workbook he recommends and actually use it. The anatomy section is tested with a relatively easy midterm. The second segment is group presentations on famous cases of abnormal cognition \u2014 think Phineas Gage, HM, ect. \u2014 that build on some anatomy knowledge but are generally interesting to work on & listen to. The take\u2013home final was based on these cases. Our seminar was also offered an opportunity during reading period to do one last \"cutting\" of the brain to access some of the structures we weren't able to physically see earlier in the class.\u00a0Overall, I'd highly recommend the course \u2014 it's a 'gem' in it's low required workload (again, you get the most if you do work outside of class that's not required) BUT it is also extremely interesting. Dr. Milberg is a gem of an instructor. He is incredibly knowledgable, friendly, accessible, and has a lot of interesting personal stories about cases he's seen throughout his career. This is a low\u2013stakes way to learn brain anatomy (which is surprisingly lacking in the College's neuroscience department) because the workload is very low and Milberg is very willing to entertain questions. Even if anatomy is not the most interesting subject for you (as it wasn't for me), examining a real human brain is a unique opportunity that is hard to come by. The cases were also very interesting with a good mix of diversity. I didn't think I had retained that much from the anatomy section but I was surprised at how much I actually remembered when we came to the cases.",

    "best_gem_comment": "DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS IF YOU ACTUALLY WANT TO LEARN ANYTHING ABOUT MARINE BIOLOGY! This course was a near\u2013complete waste of my time. I learned almost nothing. The lecture content was as basic as it gets \u2013\u2013 I think that this course would have been easily accessible to middle schoolers or even 5th graders. I was really disappointed because I am an OEB concentrator with a significant interest in marine biology and especially corals. I was really looking forward to learning from Dr Hartmann since his specialty aligns very closely with my interests. Looking at the syllabus, I imagined that the course would be taught like some other upper level OEB courses \u2013\u2013 I understood that there wasn't a lot of work involved, but I thought that meant the lectures would be really engaging and scientifically oriented, and that we would read and discuss papers, or get into the specific dynamics of various ecosystems. Instead, we spent multiple lectures on ocean zones and far too many lectures on the boggle activities. There were a bunch of random activities which don't contribute to learning at all. The only things I learned during this class came from the guest lectures and reading the textbook. I'm guessing that most of the people who took this course probably are going to give it great feedback because it was a complete Gem of a class \u2013\u2013 essentially that there was no work and it was an easy A. If you are looking for this then great, take this class. But you will be bored out of your mind, even if you don't know anything about marine biology.",

It was incredible; the speakers were amazing, Bapu is an incredible lecturer, and the topics we covered in the class are so genuinely interesting (overview of Medicare/Medicaid, payment systems for physicians, malpractice, specialization, etc). I think this is a wonderful class to take if you're even remotely interested public health, because you get a broad sense of it, especially in America.

MUSIC LISTENING: The music we listen to in this course is sooooo good, and learning to listen to it analytically is honestly super fun and rewarding. I developed a bigger appreciation for classical music but also became able to think about more modern music in a completely new light.2. IT'S NOT MUCH WORK AND NOT STRESSFUL AT ALL: A true gem. INCREDIBLY interesting lectures and course material, great assignments, also a SUPER polished and organized course. And truly, this course is not very difficult or stressful. Still, I was motivated to do well because the teaching staff is so great, which brings me to...3. THE COURSE STAFF: Oh. my. god. I LOVED my TF in this class (Cana McGhee, she's a gem), but the other ones were also SICK. Section was such a joy, had amazing convos, great music listening, and always walked out having Shazam'd at least 2 new songs.4. MICHAEL UY: This man right here, is just, *chef's kiss*. Never have I had a professor so eloquent, enthusiastic, personable, funny, polished, relatable, and SO INTELLIGENT at the same time. Every lecture, every moment of this course was made so enjoyable because of Michael. He also knew everyone's name (I'm talking like 120 people) after the second week. The man cares more than anyone I've ever met.TAKE THIS COURSE. Do it, or else I'll be disappointed in you.",
