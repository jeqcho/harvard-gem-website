Professor Eisenstein is a wonderful professor who explains concepts quite well. He is very open to answering questions throughout the class and is very humble. This is one of my favorite classes that I have ever taken at Harvard, and is a gem in my opinion\u2013 the course content is beyond fascinating. You learn about everything from black holes, quasars, dark matter, dark energy, the expansion of the Universe, before the Big Bang, etc. (again, pretty much everything) The course will be what you make out of it. I highly recommend reading the textbook chapters and modules every week and taking notes on them. Try your best not to fall behind, and definitely don't skip the readings\/modules\u2013 they're the key to doing well on the final exam and actually understanding what is going on in the class.","workload_score_mean":6.76,"best_gem_comment_short":"This is one of my favorite classes that I have ever taken at Harvard, and is a gem in my opinion\u2013 the course content is beyond fascinating.","course_id":"125884","link":"https:\/\/harvard.bluera.com\/harvard\/rpv-eng.aspx?lang=eng&redi=1&SelectedIDforPrint=d7863e67b1b954040c79af81efa0933d93b1117fe4178a729a63eb7f72598108604f7a96c7c5a07e18348fb2973daa06&ReportType=2&regl=en-US"}]
