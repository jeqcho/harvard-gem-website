Not difficult but very rewarding. You learn about lots of interesting economic and policy\u2013oriented topics that are extremely relevant to today's world, and both professors are extremely experienced\/knowledgable. Lectures are interesting and debates between the two professors especially are a gem. Exams are not difficult at all if you follow along section material and do the practice exams beforehand. The policy memo is also a great learning experience. One thing I would say is not ideal is that TFs can be hard to reach and don't host office hours often.","workload_score_mean":4.33,"best_gem_comment_short":"Lectures are interesting and debates between the two professors especially are a gem.","course_id":"123003","link":"https:\/\/harvard.bluera.com\/harvard\/rpv-eng.aspx?lang=eng&redi=1&SelectedIDforPrint=0be92c55f9ce5b7475ff798d672b78fab11808322b50bee835870595be1a3e894ab3877e98a1cfd952f11161dbb3ab36&ReportType=2&regl=en-US"},{"course_code":"ECON 70","useful_title":"Personal Finance Making Better Decisions and Building a Better Financial System","course_score_mean":3.79,"rec_score_mean":3.81,"gem_score_mean":0.0192307692,"sentiment_score_median":0.67775,"best_gem_comment":"this class is super good in providing knowledge that is very practical and applicable to real\u2013life. it is not necessarily easy or a gem though, sometimes the p sets are frustratingly poorly worded\/ difficult\/ nit picky but overall if you try you can get a good grade and learn some really practical info.","workload_score_mean":4.91,"best_gem_comment_short":"it is not necessarily easy or a gem though, sometimes the p sets are frustratingly poorly worded\/ difficult\/ nit picky but overall if you try you can get a good grade and learn some really practical info.","course_id":"218117","link":"https:\/\/harvard.bluera.com\/harvard\/rpv-eng.aspx?lang=eng&redi=1&SelectedIDforPrint=55711fcf33ecff98c0c2bfc332052da7dda605ef612674f13fa1bd12f51a31e1721176751fd8cd7980a51f1b539d447e&ReportType=2&regl=en-US"}]
