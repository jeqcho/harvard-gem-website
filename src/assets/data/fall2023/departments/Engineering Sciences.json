You have to work with a group the entire semester and how things turn out really depends on your group. The assignments aren't hard but they just have to get handed in. There is also mandatory attendance which is a bit annoying but the easy assignments, lenient grading and (mostly) great lectures makes up for this. For the midterm there are several sections that could either be done weekly or handed in all together when the midterm is due; I suggest the weekly assignments instead of cramming everything during midterm season. While many take this class for gem purposes there is also an opportunity to learn a lot! This class did a great job in showing students the ins and outs of innovation. I learned a bunch about how businesses are run and how ideas are executed well.
