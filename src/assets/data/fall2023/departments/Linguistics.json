Prof. Sag\u2013Parvardeh was really great and kind, and the entire teaching staff was really supportive. The psets were easy, short, and infrequent (too easy in my opinion) and this class was definitely a gem. This class achieved its goal in covering a broad range of introductory linguistics topics. However, this course definitely had its problems. The pacing of this class seemed really off. Lectures were attendance mandatory but they crawled by so slowly. The content that we covered in 2\u20133 classes (2.5\u20133 hrs) was covered just as easily in a 1\u2013hr section. In fact, section felt like the most important part of the class. Additionally, there were often questions that arose during section or from psets that garnered confusion among the majority of students and never actually had a clear answer.","workload_score_mean":3.38,"best_gem_comment_short":"The psets were easy, short, and infrequent (too easy in my opinion) and this class was definitely a gem.","course_id":"110785","link":"https:\/\/harvard.bluera.com\/harvard\/rpv-eng.aspx?lang=eng&redi=1&SelectedIDforPrint=f7989bce049d9b1afe2bddb3dca8d8da7c493dd2dbb23681e1824beb454a52cdf0a21e2bf2e8538730fc89d4b023d004&ReportType=2&regl=en-US"}]
