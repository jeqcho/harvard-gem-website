It is a gem in a sense that you will learn so much but you will not be extremely stressed out about grades. The grade distribution in the course is amazing. Every aspect is weighed enough so that you have to be consistent in order to do well in the course and your grade is not just reliant on a few test grades. The psets are actually fun and manageable, the course staff are accessible and ready to help or answer questions. It is a great introduction to the department.","workload_score_mean":6.02,"best_gem_comment_short":"It is a gem in a sense that you will learn so much but you will not be extremely stressed out about grades.","course_id":"207476","link":"https:\/\/harvard.bluera.com\/harvard\/rpv-eng.aspx?lang=eng&redi=1&SelectedIDforPrint=e57f0cb8f5a87853e34dcc542cb152dad80d5ed75ca8b841b138af5ecefbcd98bf347d12652dcd4e4679420dc0113d8b&ReportType=2&regl=en-US"}]
