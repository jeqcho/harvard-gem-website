I loved the entire thing. The guest lecturers, the field work, the lessons, the teaching staff!!! Chef's kiss fr. Tom and the TFs were so so so so awesome. I cannot speak highly enough of them.  Tom is a genuine gem; you do not meet many people like him in life. He truly cares about what he is teaching and offers a course that will allow you to actually gain valuable first hand experience in the topics you are learning about. You will leave this class with an entirely different view of the United States, especially since it forces you to step out of your comfort zone. Because I know people are worried about grades: It is also pretty easy as long as you engage in the material and truly care about what you are learning. Perfect introduction to a sociology course; I would recommend the course to someone without any knowledge of the department.","workload_score_mean":4.0,"best_gem_comment_short":"Tom is a genuine gem; you do not meet many people like him in life.","course_id":"220192","link":"https:\/\/harvard.bluera.com\/harvard\/rpv-eng.aspx?lang=eng&redi=1&SelectedIDforPrint=98868108c748f164f6af32d83533dbcb89d82b178f1ad72f256fca500d214ec59e2e7488f72f50e94a941e7f38c894f2&ReportType=2&regl=en-US"}]
