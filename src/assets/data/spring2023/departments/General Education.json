I think the average mention of kids per lecture is 10. this does not include mentions of other family members, friends, boring stories with no relevance to the subject, or attempts of jokes. The class might be a gem in terms of easy assignments, if you do well on the short papers and put in some effort, it should be an easy A. But is it worth it? the material is not enjoyable and the lectures consists of the professor just talking for an hour and fifteen minutes, once every other lecture she wrote something on the blackboard, but not a single picture, presentation, or anything that made it easy to follow and engaged. I would rather take a more demanding class than Happiness, which did not fulfill my expectations (which was fairly high).","workload_score_mean":2.47,"best_gem_comment_short":"The class might be a gem in terms of easy assignments, if you do well on the short papers and put in some effort, it should be an easy A.","course_id":"218240","link":"https:\/\/harvard.bluera.com\/harvard\/rpv-eng.aspx?lang=eng&redi=1&SelectedIDforPrint=dc31e47720d0f3821b0f8fafea3f1b0c79caf90740e2ed2343e75cefd0a993620624af242e1b44c01190cc3e74e90f8a&ReportType=2&regl=en-US"},{"course_code":"GENED 1049","useful_title":"East Asian Cinema","course_score_mean":4.35,"rec_score_mean":4.45,"gem_score_mean":0.0888888889,"sentiment_score_median":0.9022,"best_gem_comment":"One of those classes that can be a gem if you want but so inspiring to see people putting in so much love into the class!
