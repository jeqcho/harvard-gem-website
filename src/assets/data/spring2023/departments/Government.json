Take this class! Not only do you learn a lot of helpful material about experimental design and methods, but you learn about super cool studies across a wide array of disciplines.

I wouldn't call it a gem since you do have to put in some work into the policy memos to get an A, but otherwise the class is pretty easy (and if you do the bare minimum work you'll get an A).
