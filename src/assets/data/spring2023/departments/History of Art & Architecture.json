I recommend all students take this course!! Definitely a gem!!! The professor (Professor Georganteli is the sweetest!!!!!!) and teaching staff are amazing!

If you have any interest in exploring the philosophy of economic\/monetary systems, coin designs, the value of money from coins to NFTs, or anything that has to do with money, take this course!!!","workload_score_mean":3.74,"best_gem_comment_short":"Definitely a gem!!!","course_id":"216165","link":"https:\/\/harvard.bluera.com\/harvard\/rpv-eng.aspx?lang=eng&redi=1&SelectedIDforPrint=82597c70c6481db3988750fdb0a9b580c3094dea7d8cff7aa1189a401ff8760c7eee69254bf18e41fc4b01c316efa263&ReportType=2&regl=en-US"}]
